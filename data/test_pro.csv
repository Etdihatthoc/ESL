Three suggestions are joining a summer camp, taking a summer school or staying with his grandparents in the countryside. My best choice is joining a summer camp because of this reason. Firstly, he can learn many new things and soft skills such as problem solving skills. Secondly, he can make new friends and they can have time to know more about each other. He can share many stories and this can make my nephew become more confident. I don't think that taking a summer school or staying with my grandparents in the countryside is a suitable choice because taking a summer school can be quite expensive. Maybe we have to move from the countryside to a school which is in the suburbs or somewhere we don't know. Staying with my grandparents in the countryside is good but it will make the children become lazier. Maybe he will play video games all the time watching YouTube and this is not good for him. I think that joining a summer camp is much better than taking a summer school or staying with my grandparents in the countryside because it will have him to learn new things, make new friends, become more confident, learn so much soft skills and become a better version of himself.

I myself learned how to play the guitar when I was a teenager. I think it did help me reduce stress because I like listening to music. And most teenagers, I think they appreciate music. Most people appreciate music in one form or the other. And I think when you're learning how to play an instrument, you need to concentrate, you need to learn the skills. So again, when I was learning how to play the guitar, I had to keep practicing even though it hurt my fingers to strum because the strings were quite painful on my fingers. I carried on, I didn't give up. So that's also another reason why it's good for teenagers to play musical instrument because you're concentrating, you don't want to give up and hopefully it's something that they enjoy. Music always helps someone relax. So if you play good music, it also reduces some stress, I assume. Yes, I think music should be part of the school curriculum because not everyone is good at maths or English or science. Some children might be good at art or music or dance. Sports are also important. So if you just have academic subjects all day, it could be quite too much. It could be too mentally exhausting for the children, for teenagers. So if they have music, it could be a way to relax. Even if they're not good at singing, it could be a way to relax and enjoy the time away from the classroom where you're learning the academic subjects like English, maths and science. It also provides an all-rounded education. Not everyone is a genius at maths. You could find the next Beethoven in your music class. I think art and music should also be taught in the school. I come from Spain and the flamenco music is very popular in Spain. It's also traditional music, flamenco dance. They use the guitar a lot and the castanets are used a lot in flamenco music. It's very loud. Dancing is fantastic. So guitar music, flamenco, it's very popular in Spain. So yeah, I think teenagers should be given the opportunity to play a musical instrument. They could even be given a variety of instruments to practice in school. When I was in school, there were different instruments there. The recorder, the harmonica, the guitar, the drums, the piano. I did not learn how to play all of them because I guess I was drawn to the guitar and I just learned how to play the guitar. I still enjoy playing it. Especially when you perform. I didn't get to perform but when you play at the campsite, it's something to show off. A skill that you have.",3

Firstly, I think in school, it will have many students and lecturers who have intelligence with the poor people. They will be willing to share their money or their help to have the poor people have an opportunity or a good condition in the future. Moreover, I think that if we raise money for charity from individuals, it will not have a huge money. So it can help more people, so I think it's not the best choice. Moreover, raising money for charity from companies is very difficult because a company has many types of rules. I think it's hard to raise money from companies. To sum up, I think raising money for charity from schools is a bad choice because of the reason I mentioned above. I think raising money for charity from businesses is a bad choice.

And sometimes when we need to receive the guests from the other or we do the presentation to the guests or to the board of directors or board of management, we need to show and we need to use the projector.

Actually, you can listen and speak when you make a cake. You can feel comfortable. And thirdly, I shouldn't forget my friend who has the same interests.

I totally agree with that idea. Now, I will further discuss more about some points related to this view. To start with, in my opinion, husbands and wives should share child care responsibilities because, in my opinion, both mothers and fathers place important roles in the development of children. So, both mothers and fathers should have time with their child's children and both of them can help the children develop well. To the second point, the husband and the wife should share more routine household tasks. I totally agree with this point because nowadays, both the women and the men have their own work. Every day, both of them are very tired after the work time. When they come back home, they should share the housework together. It can help both husbands and wives to have more time to take a rest. For example, in Vietnam, many families, the husbands don't share the household with the wives. So, the wives are very tired after the work time at the office. And then, the wives have to cover their own housework. So, they are very tired. And because the wives are very tired, they are not happy. And after that, in my opinion, there are many issues that come from the wives. That's why I think sharing more routine household tasks is very important. For the last is work as a team. Because there are many problems in families, the husbands and the wives need to work together. So, they need to work as a team to have the best collaboration, to solve the problem and then to have the good results. That's why I think husbands and wives should have equal role in the family.",3

So I completely agree with this view because of some following reasons. The fourth reason is that husband and wife have equal roles. So if you have a role, you can share more routine, hold the task. When they hold the task, you can have a time together and show love for partner. Besides, they will be very happy because there is a person who shares with me anything in their life. The second reason can be a complaint that equal roles will share childcare responsibilities. The children belong to the husband and wife, so they have a responsibility for their children. So they can share children's care. When they share children's care, their children will be very happy and have love from both mother and father. So they will take love successfully. The third reason is that equal roles are working as a team. When husband and wife work as a team, everything in their life is successful. From reasons I think people should have equal roles in the family. I will answer some questions. Firstly, in the past 10 years, in family, husband usually doesn't usually do routine household tasks.

It's a chance for students to meet new people around their friends, especially when they work in a cafeteria or a coffee shop. Secondly, part-time jobs will have students improving confidence because they have to work in a new environment and have to use many work in a new environment to meet new people. So they improve their confidence through their activities. Moreover, part-time jobs could help. They develop soft skills. For example, when you work as a teacher, you have to catch your small waiters. You have to know some communication skills to work with customers. Or when you work as a tutor, you need to know more how to do proper PowerPoint and how to deliver the PowerPoint with knowledge in a simple way for the student to understand. Moreover, part-time jobs can help you have your own money increasing your earnings to help with the living and help with the rent if you are renting a dorm room or big city. In my parents' generation, there's not such thing as part-time jobs because they used to have a full-time job or choose to do a full-time job or enrolled in the army. They only have the knowledge about part-time jobs during this generation. In my country, the most popular part-time jobs are the children's because I think that it's easy to access. Many families want to have a one-on-one lesson for their children so that they can help the children to improve their productivity and reveal the lessons after school. It could benefit their children. I think they think that it would benefit their children more because they only have one teacher other than go in for a large classroom with other students. But I think that students need to balance their study and their part-time jobs and how to do that. First, they need to choose a part-time job that can fit in their schedule like a tutor because it only takes two hours a day and maybe three to five days a week.",3

I strongly agree with this opinion as in modern life both men and women are breadwinners of the family. So obviously they should share their family duties. Firstly, both husbands and wives should share the child care responsibilities. The most important reason is that if a child gets both care from mom and dad they will feel happy and can be nourished and developed in a happy environment. Secondly, both men and women should share more routine household tasks. They will have make full use of time. I mean that when the woman cooks the man can have taking a bath for the kid or teach the kid or even play with the kid. There is a very famous slogan that in a family, the famous slogan like we are one in a family. So everyone should work as a team. People should support each other whenever one member meets the differentties in their life. The members should listen and share or help the others to solve the problems in life. Besides, we should help each other with finance in the family so that all the members have the balanced life or the balanced emotion. Everyone, I suppose that everyone has the responsibility of building the strong relationship, the mutual understanding between each other in a family. As far as I know, the roles of husband and wife in my country have changed in the last ten years. It's mainly due to the responsibility of them at home and at work. Nowadays, not only men go to work to earn money, but also the women are very good employees at work who can earn a lot of money. In some families, some mothers can be the breadwinners too.

First of all, it is important to identify the students they have faced with the shame environment. They don't know about the situation here at work, they know about whether people are nice or not. The fact that they have to face a lot of strangers not knowing that they are good enough can lead to some serious problems like kidnapping, or food in a new environment may be not good for them, they can have allergies, can heartbeat the door and lose weight. The second one is homesickness. Far from home is far from your family and friends, you have to make new home in your environment and not to miss any of them. The third one is high living cost. The colleges are usually in the mayor city that may have high rent and traffic is not so much. So not only they have to pay rent but also for travel or the cost for travel around the place. Now I will answer the follow up questions. The biggest advantage of attending college far from home is not spending a lot with the environment or homesickness. I would pay for local and far away colleges because I think that by these opportunities students will have the chance to learn new things, new culture and not get to know many brands from many different places. Also, about the statement going to college far from home brings you a chance to get out of your comfort zone, I totally agree with that. Because at home you have to take the provisions or something, you don't have to leave under your parents eyes, everything you do is under their control.

Also this festival is a way to preserve our culture because many of them could be lost in our future if we do not promote them in a very regular way. So it also provides the local community with a chance to promote their hometown and boosting their local economy with different ways. A traditional event is also kind of like a platform where people could meet each other and really get to know each other. It's a place where all the people in the community could get attached and got a chance to really share a giving and also helping the community to strengthen their bonding.

Why Hanoi is the best destination for him? Firstly, because he is planning to come to Vietnam in the time of September or November. Hanoi is the best choice because during this time, the temperature and the humidity in Hanoi is very suitable for European people when they stay here. If they come in December, January or February, maybe it's too cold and during the summer it's too hot, but September and November is the best. When you stay in Hanoi and you can walk along the lake of Huan Quiem, inside of it in Hanoi we have many activities that we can do during the 3 days. Normally, when my friend, when my European friend comes to Hanoi, in the first day I will take them, go around by mobility, by motorbike and then we will stop at some Vietnamese restaurant. We can try to eat some Thai food or some Vietnamese food and all the way and often my European friend very appreciates Vietnamese food in Hanoi. And then, people in Hanoi are very friendly. Besides of it, when you stay in Hanoi for 3 days, you can very easily connect to other tourism cities in the North of Vietnam. For example, you can take a tour, go to Sapa and come back to Hanoi in 1.5 days or in 2 days. Or if you only want to spend only 1 day for the trip, you can go to Ha Long Bay. You go to Ha Long Bay in the morning and you can come back to Hanoi in the later evening. And during the night time, we can have free time to go to the bar, to take some train and to watch, to see how the Vietnamese people are living in Hanoi in the night time. So it is very highly recommended to stay in Hanoi. For more information, visit www.hana.gov.",2

We just be far from mobile phones, the technology that usually keep us isolated. There are plenty of possible activities that we can take in a picnic. For example, a barbecue. Everyone loves something to eat. There are many games that we can participate in and getting used to each other. Getting more known for contests with girls in this class. It is certainly a good idea, but today is for girls. We boys are supposed to provide and help the girls. We are not trying to let them compete with each other. It's just a point of me. We should let them have the fun. We would contest with each other. That would be great. Let the girls be the audience. A bar is also a good choice. The cost is not everyone can afford it unless we have a shared fund. Not everyone is keen on the singing. Not everyone is good at it. Some of the people who love to sing are not good. They are bad singers. It's a hard truth. I have met that situation many times. If I were the one to organize a party for Women's Day, I would choose to have everyone join a picnic.

I feel that group work should be encouraged as one. First and foremost, group work gives up leadership skills because when they do work together, they need to hear ideas from many people in the group. Secondly, group work promotes cooperation. Finally, group work makes people more interested because when they do work together, they improve many skills. Many people cannot study skills with people in a group. I think group work should be encouraged as one. Next, I will answer some questions. What makes a good team leader? I think a good team leader needs to have many skills and to have a responsible group of people in the group. Group work is a deep right on peaceful identity. Next, I will answer some questions. What should we do to deal with encourage members? I think people need to have ideas with people and to help people when they lost their skills. So, it's my end of the question.",3

That means you can go with your backpack and find yourself with the bike to a second way that you can come with the bike to help you. Then you have some people who will introduce you about the location and another is a road trip. The road trip is like you go in the road and go from the north side to the south side of Vietnam. So in my opinion, I found that the road trip is the best way to planning to go to Vietnam through summer vacation by following a statement. First, you go to the road trip. That means you will go with your car and with a lot of stuff you can prepare before. That means it's better than a backpack trip that you can prepare more stuff you need than just like to store in your car but not even in only a backpack. It's better than the guide tour because you can have the free choice to choose because in the guide tour you have to follow their plan, follow their route. But in the road trip, you can have both benefits of backpack trip or guide tour. Another reason is that Vietnam has the development route and you can go across from south to north side easily and you can see the many beauty like a beach or mountain in Vietnam.",2

The first option giving them a zero. The second option reducing 50% of the total score. The third option is dismissing. In my opinion reducing 50% of the total score is the best option because of some following reasons. The third reason I would mention is that reducing 15% of the total score is good and suitable. The second reason I could explain is that reducing 15% of the total score is a zero. There are several reasons why I don't choose all the options. I don't think option one giving them a zero is a good choice. Simply because it is not useful. It makes students scared. Moreover it is inconvenient. Although dismissing them sounds good but I don't choose it because it is unsuitable. To sum up if I were in that situation I would choose reducing 15% of the total score due to the above reasons. People should have a further consideration on this issue. Thank you.,2

I would like to show John because Hanoi has a quarter town where they have 36 streets and you can find special stock selling on the name of street. For example, the Hang Vai. So they have lots of fabrics on Hang Vai. In the quarter of the hotel at the night time they also have beer streets, they call Ta Hien.

In the early morning you can see a lot of the lady with the Vietnamese tradition hat on the bicycle with a lot of flowers, fruit, some kind of stuff that is selling and you can buy to her very cheap.

They definitely do establish strong relationships when working with one another. The leader of a team will definitely develop some development from leadership qualities and of course we will see an improvement in communication skills between the team members. What are some possible problems when working in a team? Usually working in a team can cause some irresponsibility. I think we all have experienced this in university when we were assigned a team project. There will definitely be some students lacking behind and not in the work they're supposed to do, not finishing the deadlines on time and hence will affect the entire team's performance. Definitely working in a team will be hard for someone who is an introvert. I would say those are the possible problems when working in a team. How can teamwork within an organization be promoted? Teamworking spirit can be promoted through establishing strong relationships. If an organization can have meetings prior to a team working task, then the team members can definitely feel more responsible in taking part in the task as well. Having a meeting before will set a spirit for the team knowing that they are accounted for what they do in a team and whatever the team gets, they will also get. Teamwork is more important for adults than for children. Do you agree or disagree? I definitely disagree to this because I believe that everything is built from the root. This means that teamwork is a skill built from a younger age. Now back to the benefit when teamwork is promoted in the workplace. There are three reasons I think that there are three benefits for teamwork in the workplace. First of all, it develops leadership qualities not only for the leader but also for the team members. The leaders have to make decisions and they have to guide the team in a specific route in order for the team to get to the goal. Hence I think this will definitely develop some leadership quality. Working in a team will definitely improve communication skills since every member has to talk to one another to see how the progress of each task is going in order to fill in for one another or to assist one another to finish the job before deadline. Everyone is working together hence they need to communicate more. They definitely do establish strong relationships because it is said that people who go through hardship together tend to be more bonded.",3

I think that we could encourage them, but they had a lot of problems with traveling at a young age. First, let's talk about the advantage. You could experience different cultures, different people in different countries. The first thing I could think of is the people. They live a different life and a different way of thinking. So you could learn a lot from them, understand their culture, and why they live the way they are, to get an insight on their culture. Of course, I have to talk about the food. Different cultures have different kinds of prepared meals. Food is a very important part of the country's culture. You could also see how people live their lives, how it affects their relationship with each other, and learn from them. There is a lot to discover all around the world. But a downside is that young people don't usually have a lot of money, and they have to think about their future. They have to prepare for their college, their fees. Not a lot of people have enough money to travel the world. Especially in my country, in Vietnam, an undeveloped country, we don't have a lot of money, especially the young people. So I think that it only applies to developed countries like the US or Europe countries. But if young people have enough money, I think that it's very good for you. Maybe people could go by starting a boat, but then again, it's not really a travelling way. And travelling alone is dangerous in some parts of the world. Not everywhere is secure and has peaceful life like in Vietnam. If you plan on travelling to another country, you will have to prepare a lot for your trip. And that also requires a lot of money.",3

Firstly the elders should be used for raising beds because the raising beds will bring the release stress, increase the social interactions and help exercise partners. The stress release is very important in our life so raising beds will bring the good atmosphere and the good quality for children to reduce stress and release stress. Furthermore if the children raise a bed they can do the exercise and can have something in common with the beds. Moreover increase social interaction is very important too because it is a skill for children and people to make friends and to connect with each other. In addition it also raises awareness and expands our knowledge when we have a good interaction with social when we have good social interaction. The final raising beds will make children have exercise partners because we don't have too much time to stay with children so raising beds will bring for them a partner and a friend which will bring the good emotions for the children and furthermore the beds will be a partner for children to share the happiness and share the sadness when after studying at school. In conclusion I think that reduce stress is very important so if we raise a bed for children to take care we can help children reduce stress. Secondly the interaction is very important so if children can contact with other pets so they can connect with friends and with families so that children can express our thinking and express our problems for family and for friends to solve it.

Firstly, I often spend many hours after spending a lot of time in the classroom. I want to go outside and do some exercises so that the exercises could help me counteract the negative impact of sitting in the classroom. In other words, the exercises could help me achieve good health. What's more, while doing the exercises, I could temporarily forget about all the intense academic lessons that I have. Doing those moments that I do the exercises could help me relax my mind and regain the mental energy that I need for the next academic classes. Personally speaking, during my breaks, I often play football with my friends. I particularly like football because when playing the sport, not only can I do exercise, I also have the opportunity to run in a team with my friends. That team could really help me strengthen our relationships when all team members work together to achieve the team's goals. That is, in my opinion, a very good way for me to talk with my friends even when I don't have to exchange verbal words with them. I obviously don't choose to read books because after an academic class, I no longer have any desire to sit for another 15 minutes in the classroom and take in some other pieces of information from the book. But I instead want to go outside and do some exercises. So that is the reason why I would go for the third option which is doing exercises.",2

The first, a water park will be suitable for every generation. You can bring your kids and also the old and the middle age people will like it and have a lot of things to entertain when you go to the water park. For example, I once take my family, my Islamic family, including my grandmothers and grandfathers into the Hoi An water park. There are some spas and hot water tops for the old. I think it's quite convenient for me to arrange. There are a lot of reasons why I don't choose the other choices. The first, an amusement park mostly has a lot of games for children, but there's nothing for the adult to do. When I go to the amusement park, you can see that most of the adults or the grown-ups will stay there watching their children play without having any real entertainment. A museum is a last choice because I think it's inappropriate for a big group. When you go to the museum, you need to really focus on observing and elaborating the picture and the work arcs. So, anyway, most museums do not allow you to talk a lot in the museum. So, it's really not suitable for a family gathering when you have at least four to three and even more than five people. So, you can stop them making noise and it will be awkward for you when you take your family to the museum.",2

First of all, it is suitable for me. I like that. I am a big fan of photo. Second of all, it is very cheap. And very fun. I don't think that's being a collab and form is a better, is a good choice. Because it is not good and not suitable for me. I don't like product collab video because it is very expensive. It is cheap. And it is not suitable for me to sum up. I believe that marking a collab photo album is the best choice. Thank you.",2

First, they telling lies to get out of trouble because parents may be too tricky so children are afraid of making mistakes. Therefore, they tell lies to get out of trouble. Secondly, children don't want each other to know their secrets. Therefore, they tell lies to protect their privacy. They can't keep their secrets. Thirdly, maybe they get embarrassed before when they make mistakes. So, when they make mistakes again, they tell lies to avoid embarrassment. And last but not least, children telling lies because they watch some video and have bad content. So, they can learn bad things in what they watch. Now, I answer follow-up questions. I think telling lies is a bad effect to children because they can learn the best way to grow in a bad way. In the future, they will tell lies when every mistake they make. I think to encourage children to tell the truth is parents shouldn't be too tricky. Parents should encourage children telling the truth. Although the truth is maybe they make mistakes and parents should talk to their children more closely to children. Therefore, children can believe their parents and they will tell the truth when something happens. The first question is saying nothing the same as telling lies.",3

I believe that going into art galleries has many benefits. I don't have any advantage for the young people. The essay will not take up the benefit of art galleries. First of all, going to the art galleries helps people relax after hard working time. In modern life, people have to work with smartphones and computers during a long time. So, when going to the art galleries, it helps their eyes relax. Besides the secondary merit of art galleries, it has improved people's knowledge.

And I believe that we should have solutions to alleviate the consumption of fast food. And here's some of mine. First of all, I believe that to reduce the consumption of fast food, we need to build a diet which is planned for our meals in every breakfast, lunch or in the evening. So, I believe that when we have our own diet, we will keep track on our food and what we obtain and consume. Therefore, it is a necessary thing to do when we need to cut down the amount of fast food we obtain every day. And the second thing I want to talk about is we need to raise awareness, definitely self-awareness from people, especially the children. We all know that the percentage of overweight children in all over the world is really high. It is mainly because their parents, they let their children eat a lot of fast food. Therefore, I need parents in every country, in every nation, to have a solution to alleviate or to cope with the situation by teaching their children not to eat too much fast food, which is not really good or definitely bad for their health. And another way is I believe that fast food is mainly eaten not because of its flavor, but also because people are really rushed to work. Therefore, I believe that they should avoid getting in a hurry. So, they need to prepare for everything carefully. Therefore, they don't have to eat fast food. And I believe that people need not to get really hungry because by managing your diet, you can keep track with your food. Therefore, you will not feel hungry anymore. And to answer the first question, in my opinion, the reason why people eat fast food is because of its flavor. It is really delicious. And more and more, maybe they are really hungry, like you just have 5 minutes to get to work. Therefore, just a packet of noodle or just a bread full of fried chicken or fried something else like that is really bad for your health. But it is really convenient. Therefore, people mostly choose fast food to eat in their break time. And to answer the second question, people switch their fast food to their main meals. I think it is definitely really really bad. Because as I have told you before, by managing our diet, we have to keep track of all the food we are obtaining. Therefore, if we switch our main meals by fast food, which is mainly KFC chicken, fried chicken or even something full of sweets or candies, it is really bad for our health. Which will gain a lot of weight and make us become overweight. And the last question, if taxation is not really good because it will pull down all economics, therefore people should raise their own awareness to get lean and keep fit.",3

I know what types of champagne he likes so it is very easy for me to buy for him. Moreover, it is useful. When drinking champagne, my father will feel relaxed and happy. There are several reasons why I don't choose other options. First of all, they are unsuitable. About a puppy, my father doesn't like animals. In my house, there is a marble that is a band in my house. It is not allowed to raise animals in a house. Although buying a tag sounds interesting, I don't have enough money to buy.

So travelling by planes nowadays is very common and there are lots of advantages of travelling by plane which is suitable for long distance. We can get from to the destination we want with amount of time, it is very fast and also convenient. We can have a lot of things on the airplane which is such as the toilet, the food and everything we need when we travel. But in my opinion there are also the disadvantages of travelling by plane. Travelling by plane is one of the most common travel ideas but if you travel by plane it will cost you a lot of money more than travelling by car and maybe by train. Also sometimes you can get delays, unwanted delays if you are travelling by plane. You cannot control your time like you go by bus, by car or maybe by the train. One more thing I need to mention is that travelling by plane you can get air sickness more than by car and by train. So to avoid that we can in my opinion we should eat well, eat the food we feel comfortable and then we can take some pills to avoid the sickness. I think one of the most popular means of transport in the next 20 years is train in my opinion because nowadays we can see that a lot of long distance train with a fast, with a fast, the train with a long distance with a fast, but faster more than before. So it can cost I think less than when you travel by plane and I think this is the most popular means of transport in the next 20 years because if you can mention to the car it can cost a lot of population by the train, the airplane or the car or the bus export to the air quality. It's also I think transport by train is also economically and reduce the air pollution.",3

In my opinion, the equal partnership is very important in a family relationship because currently, feminism is developing a subject and has a lot of work to do and a lot of problems to consider. Currently, because of feminism propaganda, feminism tendons, now women and men have the opportunity of education and work at the same and equal. Wife and husband have the business work at a similar business work from 8 to 5. That's why they have to share more routine household tasks because it's very important to balance the work and the life. If the wife and the husband have the same amount of business work, they could have the household tasks as well. One can cook and another can clean. That's very equal and for the saving time for both of them. The sharing is an act of romantic and respect as well. Another problem is the childcare responsibility. I think that's very important. Most of the wife and husband have to spend time with child to educate them and play with them. They can work as a team for a successful family relationship. In the last 10 years, the role of the husband in my country has changed a lot. The family is now considered as important. The grandparents play a role in challenging their families as well.",3

Firstly, when students have to rewrite the task 10 times, they have opportunity to remember the task. And then they will not forget the homework again. Another benefit is that they can save a lot of money. I would not choice the option required them to stand at the classroom corner for one hour because it will make them feel tired and make them feel lonely. They cannot pay attention to the class and it will have a bad effect on their story result. About asking the students to give some money to the class fund, I would not accept this way because the students usually don't have money so they cannot give money to the class fund. In summary, my best choice is ask the students to rewrite the task 10 times for the following reason. I would not choice the option required them to read the task 10 times.

You don't have to leave the home, you don't have to commute. You just have to go in front of the computer and you can learn. It could be anywhere, you could learn it from home, you could learn from a cafe. It could be anywhere whilst you're doing online learning. So it's convenient. Anyone can do it and anyone can be in any part of the world. You could be on holiday and you can still do e-learning. It's cost saving, yes, because I guess you're saving money on the commute and time is money. So you're saving money by doing a course online. And usually online courses are cheaper than actually attending a real course in person. Time saving because less time on commute and getting there and organizing yourself, so there's less time. And I think online learning also offers you many opportunities because sometimes in a place where you live only certain courses might be offered. However, online, I mean there's a plethora of options. There are different courses you can do. You can even learn cooking online these days. So there are many more options with online learning. You could learn a variety of things which may be limited. As compared to going somewhere in person, there are limitations. There may be certain courses offered, whereas online, a wide variety of courses are offered. Who may benefit most from e-learning? I guess people who have children at home, parents who have children at home, young children especially, who need to be looked after. And if they would like to do a course in the evenings, then they could still be at home, in the comfort of their homes, and children are watched, they're minded. So they don't have to get a child minder, so it's more cost effective. And you can do it from the comfort of your own home. So people who have dependents at home, young dependents, they would benefit most. I think, yes, online learning would become more popular in the future because of the recent pandemic. During COVID-19, I'm a teacher, so during COVID-19, I had to teach online and we all learned how to teach online. And children, and most people, learn how to learn online. Everyone, I think the whole world had to learn how to work online. So we're all very familiar with it now. And in fact, we've carried on learning online. It's become more popular since the pandemic. And who knows, in the future we might have different viruses and we might have more quarantine or more options to work from home. If there's an illness, then most people, if you're ill, you could work from home or learn from home. So I think online learning is definitely going to be more popular in the future. There are many advantages to it. And we have realized that it is very successful and useful. So definitely, there will be more online learning in the future. It will be more popular in the future. It's the way forward.",3

Apparently there are three suggested options which are marks only, comments only, or both marks and comments. In my opinion, I think we should combine both marks and comments to assess students. With marks only, you can tell it's easier for the teacher to grade their students' work. They can grade their students alphabetically or numerically, such as from 1 to 10, or from A to D or E. I think that is a very fair way of assessing a student, but it works only on a paper work, like a paper exam or paper test. It would be a little bit more tricky to assess oral tests, in which I think comments come in handy, in which the teacher can provide a more comprehensive way of judging a student. They can provide the parents with more insights of how the students are doing. But I think the best way is to combine both marks and comments, since the parents are always worried and concerned about how their children are doing, and therefore I think the more the parents get to know about their children's work, the better. Students can know both how the student does according to the numbers or the alphabet, or the letters, but also know how the teacher really felt about the kids' work.",2

So both parties can hell on or can be queued up without alcohol or some wine or something like that. We can choose the champagne there but to me the pot of champagne could have another meaningful thing.

There are several reasons why I don't choose the bottle of flowers and the cup. Because to me the flower will just be meaningful to the female and the flowers cannot leave you down. And the fresh flowers cannot leave lungs.

They can bring a source of information in the words that Vietnam had faced the other countries and they can bring the information about how and what the old people lived and worked in the past centuries. In addition, after going to the museum, the students can share their knowledge that they learned in the museum with the others and I think that will be a good topic for their conversation to their friends or their parents.

Everything that can be seen in the museum, they can surf the Internet and because it's quick and very flexible to source information on the Internet, they can see, they can learn on the Internet and they don't have to go to the museum.

But many students live in the countryside and rural and when they go to the university, you must rent accommodation and live alone without any ticket from their parents. I think this is a positive situation because when they are living independently, you can boost their confidence, you can learn about everything, learn about essential vital things to survival like cooking, like cleaning and doing laundry. And you can be self-confident to face with the parents and face with many problems in society. And they are much more responsible for yourself and they can live your life to the full.

The cost of a designer should be higher. So most of the children cannot pay for this. Furthermore, one person has an each-out fabric of clothing, so not suitable for choose a kind of shirt can be for everyone. Secondly, making a class photo uniform is not convenient because a photo can record our activity and the photograph is not lively. Furthermore, when we print photographs, the quality of pictures is not really good. Lastly, about the processing of a class video is more suitable because a class video can record all of the activity in our class.

I think that in my country these facilities are used quite often, especially by people that do not have this facility at home. And it's quite sought after that they really need this resource. Where they could go, for example, after school and use this facility to their best ability. And this benefits them doing research for school and doing better in school in general. And also picking up public knowledge. For example, health and safety, things that could help them not make, for example, wrong decisions in their lives. Where they could learn stuff where maybe they're not learning it at school. This could be anything from young pregnancy to anything based that could help them shape their lives where maybe this information is left at school. I think that to make libraries more attractive, I think this could be a team building aspect where schools can come together. And they can think of ideas where they can build and basically add on to the existing library. They could all have, for example, a field or a spot in the library where they can change if it's not being art. Or it could be anything based as an advertisement with their school. Rewards could be achievements that's been made in their school. Even advertising the school and in general also once again someone that achieved something in school that could actually also even place their achievement in the library and feel proud and be proud of it. And then on the side, how do I think libraries will change in the future? I think that there will be a lot of digital marketing, digital signage. Everything will be more touch screen related. Maybe more holographic keyboards, I would say. Even though due to futuristic after Covid-19 that we've been through, it will be easier to clean. There will be minimalistic things everywhere. For example computer screens, everything would be holographic. It might even tend up to be a VR situation. Whereas you would have all your books in VR and I think that would be very interesting to see. Having a VR headset placed on your head and you could even read books in VR. You could check them out, check them back in and you could use them as a student. You could physically check out the book in your VR headset. This could be a facility that could still be provided to students and the youth that do not have these privileges. This would be quite interesting for them to look at videos and look at occupations where they can grow and learn new things. And even see it on a day to day life. Whereas they would never be able to see this. But also in a very child friendly and safety manner. Whereas it is very restricted and it is only school and knowledge based material that is provided to them via this digital platform. Thank you so much for listening. Goodbye.",3

But I think that this is not suitable because there are a lot of second hand markets out there and they work and they run it better. If we organize a second hand market, it will not be our strong point to get what we want. About the marathon, it is quite easy to organize the school concert but not all the students can join it.

Nowadays, I would like to tell you about the role of their family or equal partnership. Firstly, when they become a partnership, they can share more relative how they hold task. For example, the man or husband can do housework. Besides, the woman can go to earn more money because the woman wants to develop their career. Besides, they can share the children's responsibility about their future. The husband does housework instead of taking children to the sultry. Nowadays, the woman can go out on Monday and take care of the children. Finally, if the family is a player of the role, the people work against the ban on more time. With the family, they can enjoy the moment of life and they can have a better life together. I think that the role of the husband and wife can be changed in a 10 year because it has many benefits. The role of the grandparent in the family is to take care of children or take children about many social skills such as communication skills, teamwork skills.

Well, first of all, in my opinion, I do think that this opinion is right. First, living dependently can decrease the burden on others, especially with your family and your friends. It also can boost your self-confidence and increase your resilience and the adaptation to new ideas and new changes. And furthermore, you can be more responsible for what you have done and what you will do in the future. In the past, parents have different ways of teaching children and to help them pursue their careers. But it's the old stories. In the past, Asian parents have the tendency to teach children in traditional way, by putting so much high expectation on their own children. But now, we have changed so much since then. Teenagers in my country, in Vietnam, of course, have more opportunities to live independently in the future, because our country is opening up with the other countries, which we could call the international integration. This incident could bring a lot of chances and a lot of opportunities for children, for students to increase their international network, and a lot of resources all over the world. Like, for example, they could become international citizen. That's a good thing, right? And they can have more chance to get into the diversity of culture, of ethnic, of race, and other environment. So, what is the role of the parents in helping their children live more independently? I think we should put parents in the role of a company person or people, rather than put them into the control of status. By accompanying with your children, you can help them to enhance their skill, improve their ability, and to increase their empathy, their interaction, and also their confidence to live with the changes in this life. So, in my own ideas, I do think teenagers should be encouraged to live more independently. Maybe our culture is lean much on the community, like Vietnamese culture, you know? But, maybe it's the right time for us to change, to adapt, and to integrate with the world, like every person in this life, or this community, or this society, should and should be more independent of their own family, so that they can achieve more in their future orientation and career path. Like, that's my opinion.",3

Self-study skills are one of the most important things that men could teach themselves because nobody teaches that. I think most people have the urge to study those skills but all they can find is through self-help books and podcasts which are not the ideal places to get the idea from. It should be from the parents, from the community, from the teachers if possible. I think nothing should be compulsory at school. School is a place to boost development in a way that benefits the most each individual because everyone has different strengths in different fields and I think nothing should be compulsory. I think self-study skills should be, should appear in schools, in all kinds of schools. You need to learn how to be committed, how to be dedicated to your craft and how do you do it. You need to be at peace with yourself, inner peace. Lots of things that happen in your mind, in your head and outer peace. The way you treat people because if you treat people right they will treat you well. Why is it related to self-study? All of those things seem minor but they actually play a huge role in self-study. Self-study is also about integrity and forming trust. Trust equals wealth and so is integrity. The purpose of self-study is to improve and the improvement will bring success, money and all the things that you want in life. It will not be reachable without integrity and trust. Integrity and trust are an important part of self-study. I think the lack of self-study skills, well, it affects performance at the university. Nobody tells you what to do and you can go to class or not. It's your choice. You need to be integral to sit on the desk and study and finish the deadlines on time.

This advice will make the students be confident in themselves. This advice will make the students choose their way in education.

The most common one is often the sport club or drama or, you know, a hobby kind of class or just taking some certain class or stuff like that. Well, some of the main benefit is it helps children to manage time better. Activities are always time consuming and kids have school assignment to do. So in order to balance their hobby activities and their school education, they themselves need to learn how to use time more efficiently. It also helps them get better at communicating with strangers because most of the activity are group based. And it also creates relationships that can benefit them later in life. You know, having a friend that is doing something else in other music can help them with time in this. So with all these benefits, some people might suggest that the extra-curricular activities should be mandatory. However, I don't think that is a right approach. Why? Because kids always choose their after school activities based on their own personal preference. So the school themselves, the authority or city development themselves, cannot write everything for students because some people go online and discuss some scientific movie and stuff online and all have computer science interests. So it is absolutely not suitable to make it mandatory because you can't feed everyone and making it mandatory would be... Having a person would make it natural for people or children to participate. And what we should be doing instead is encourage them to participate in this activity. How I do not know clear but a few ideas is that we should get the children to try out activities, attend an overview class on what it is and how you do it and the commitment and the requirement to effectively do this activity. Some children don't really know what they like until we show them. And of course, we should provide appropriate facilities and land so that students can actually participate in this activity instead of just a theory on paper.",3

And if I were a person in the council, I would suggest that they should plant more trees instead of relocating hospitals or building factories to recycle waste. Well, first of all, the reason why I suggest planting trees is that we all know that the ozone flat has been dried through and the ice in each pole is melting, causing the rising of sea level. And the environment is very polluted, especially in Hanoi, where it is the second polluted city in the world recently. Well, yes, planting trees is another reason that more and more trees are being cut down, causing rising of sea levels, the burning of the forest. So, I would suggest that we can reduce the infection of these causes. Well, about recoding hospitals to suburbs, in my opinion, there will be no need to recoding hospitals to suburbs. Well, as the medication and hospitals are no longer poor like today used to be, there are many hospitals almost everywhere. So, just for relocating, if we spend money to improve it, that will be better, but relocate is no need. And next, the reason why I didn't choose the building factory to recycle waste is because it is similar to the hospitals. The technology is currently very improved. So, recycle waste, there are many methods to recycle waste nowadays, which cause no infection to the environment. But again, if the money were used to improve the factory, that would be necessary, but you don't need to.",2

Firstly, when you go online shopping, you will have flexible shopping time such as you can use your smartphone or laptop to buy online products whenever you have spare time, when you take a rest or after dinner at home. Secondly, online shopping has quick money transaction. Nowadays you don't have to pay for goods or buy cards because nowadays we use smart banking and we can use this to pay for products with some click. Thirdly, when we go shopping online, it is very easy to compare the price between the products. We can visit some shops and look for the cheapest products to buy.",3

Moreover, because they are students so they don't have much money, so homestay I think is the most suitable choice, we say it's suitable for their wallet. And for the two other options, in my opinion, a hotel is not a good idea because in a hotel you can't cook and the price is expensive, so maybe they don't have enough money to pay. Moreover, a hotel has so many pupils, so maybe it can annoy them because it's too small, too noisy. For the flat, I think it's expensive too, so it's not a good opinion. Moreover, a flat is too big for a group of students and they just go for a trip to Da Nang in several days, so I think if you have to pay so much money for the accommodation so that you can have more money to go outside and enjoy Da Nang.",2

Their passion grows around their stars. This is also a daily or weekly hobby which they can indulge in. There are many sporting events with violence included. Sometimes in my country, where you get passionate sports fans who are angry if their team didn't win, this will obviously upset them quite a lot. If there is alcohol involved or anything around the sport center or at the field, some people tend to get a bit violent because they are very unhappy with their team losing. Some people might say something to one another and this could spark a rage. What are the benefits of international sporting events? In South Africa we have had the 2010 World Cup and this definitely boosted our economy. Throughout the whole country we had in multiple towns and cities stadiums built. In general, with having the whole world there and people all around the world on multiple occasions, this boosted our economy and it did very well for our country. How often do I get sick? Quite lately I haven't been sick that often. I have tended to build up some immunity here in Vietnam. Before that I was quite sick quite often. Normally with bronchitis, I think it is due to hot cold, meaning for example very hot outside and then going back inside with an aircon. This tended to activate bronchitis in my lungs. The best way to avoid getting sick is to control the temperature, not have a very high cold or very low cold and very high yield going in and out and sticking to one temperature.

Another reason I choose the teacher-accessment way is because the teacher will talk to students usually and everyday. The teacher-accessment, they can know the weakness and strength of the student. And also through the access and assessment, the teacher can also help the student improve their weakness and boost their strength. And the last reason I choose the teacher-accessment is because the teacher can evaluate the student's attitude and behavior through the exam.

Last but not least, parents teach their children's love and risk possibilities. Children are always sharing with them and when children ask them some advice, ask their parents some advice for love. Now I will answer the following question. Parents support teachers in education, teaching their children about love and responsibility. Children always have not close with their teacher because teacher is their teacher and parents need to discuss with teacher about the lesson to educate about their own children.

And this advantage of working a group, I think that besides the advantage, there are some differences of working a group. I think the first one is, the first one is the ex-student when working in group, maybe they feel quite difficult to choose the role, their task, to connect to other member on the group. And maybe the group, in the group, the one student cannot have time to make a thinking to analyze deeply about one problem. And another disadvantage of that, when they working on group, is depend on the knowledge and skill of the other member of group. There are some examples of the group, the member group is not balanced about the knowledge and skill is the, will make the group difficult to reach the destiny, the purpose. And if group do not have a good leader, maybe it's difficult for the member to, work together and find the task, find the purpose of the group. Okay, it's three disadvantage of when we work in group.

I still like it when I get older because my sister understands me a lot and we can share a lot of things to each other. Not only about the work, about the hobbies and also how to teach our kids.

You know something funny happened today when I was doing the reading test there was a question that bore a mistake. The question was asking about a guy called Brammose who was not even mentioned in the test. And it was asking about his opinion. How can I do that? How can I find the answer? You need the last scale inspection and recheck of all the versions of the test to ensure that there is no mistakes. In order to stay competitive in the market and to be able to struggle with the other tests available in the market now, you should be able to eliminate all the mistakes. That's my advice. Ok, so I don't think I will talk more about anything. This is the end of it. Let me see, let's talk about weather forecasting and about libraries. How is the weather forecast in your country? Well, we rely on many sources of forecasts in our country. Mostly some internet sources are more reliable than the ones aired on the national television system. Do you like the way the weather is forecast in your country? There are many choices available. If I don't like one way, I would choose another. The thing is that I know English and I can read the forecast from international sources. So I don't think there is any need to change the forecast system in my country because there may be some people who like it. What are the benefits of the weather forecast? There are many benefits. At least you know how the weather is going to be. It is especially beneficial to the farmers and the people who are travelling on the sea. The shipments of the cruisers know in advance what the weather is going to be and they have the plan for the bad situations. Have you been to the library? Yes, I have been there a few times but it was many years ago.",1

This is where you transition from school to the grown-up world, as they say. University really teaches you a lot of independence. You have to get up early and make sure that you get to the university on time for your classes. You have to prepare your own meals, make sure that your apartment is clean, depending on where you live. In my experience, I lived in a one-bedroom apartment, so it taught me a lot of independence. Make sure that I clean my apartment, have food to eat, and then also make sure that I do my activities, like preparing for tests and my assignments have to be handed in on time, so definitely a lot of independence. Make sure that you have the social network, where you make new friends, hang out with your friends. It also teaches you responsibility, depending on where you go and what you do. Definitely a place where you make new friends. You might lose some old friends, but this is where you make new friends. Then, knowledge achievement. Obviously, you are going to university for a reason. This is where you learn new knowledge, new skills, to prepare you for the grown-up life, as they say. Most people don't use all the knowledge that they achieved, or they don't achieve enough knowledge, depending on how they approach university. If they think it's just going to be one big party, then the knowledge achievement won't be that great. But, like I said, you are there for a reason. You are there to study and get a university degree in whatever field you choose. It will stick with you for the rest of your life. Very, very important. So, like I said, university is the most fun that you will have in your life. It is the transition from school, living with your parents, in my experience, and then moving to the grown-up world. So, it's like you have a foot in both worlds. It slowly prepares you to get ready for the grown-up world, where you have to take responsibility for your own actions, make sure that you have all the steps that you need to take to make sure that you have everything that you need, because you are going to have to build a life of your own, where you have your own family one day.

First of all, when teenagers have to live more independently, it means they can put themselves confident because they must learn the way to cook, to study a lot, and besides, they can decrease burden on others because they must learn to take care of their shells. They must learn how to take care of themselves on the right way, such as cook meals when they are hungry, buy many household things when they need, and so on. So it can decrease burden on others. The last reason teenagers should live more independently is that they will be more responsible. It is because they must learn how to take care of themselves and they must know what they want, what they should do, and they should know the way their behaviors all communicate with each other. So living independently will help them be more responsible with their future. Now I'm going to answer the question. In the past 10 years, parents teach their children in many different ways. They teach their children about the way to apply words, the way to behaviors with others. Besides, in the past 10 years, they don't have the internet, so it has been difficult. I think teenagers in my country have more opportunities to live independently in the future because they must know what they want and what they should do and they should be more responsible with their future.

Because first of all it creates a very unfair competition with Authentic Goods. Let's say I buy a pair of Nike shoes, Authentic one could cost me $100. But the fake one would cost only $20 or $30. It would harm the person selling the Authentic Goods. Fake Goods also reduce the trust of the customer because they don't know which one is real and which one is not. The most serious thing is because of the quality. Some of the fake goods have a very low quality compared to the Authentic one. When you use it, it could also cause harm to your body. But despite all bad things, people buy a lot of fake goods. First of all, it is much cheaper and it is much easier to get. Second of all, they don't really care about the quality of the product. They just need the brand to show off to their friends or family to feel good about it. And last of all, I think maybe because it is not harming their health, they could just use the more approachable way to meet their needs. And for me, even if they are not harmful to my health, I don't think I will use it. Why? Because I feel unfair for the ones who make authentic goods. They have to put in real time, they have to put in their brand a lot of time, a lot of process to make a very good product that they can be proud of and sell it at their own reasonable price. And with the use of low quality fake goods, all of that process is not there anymore. They are just using the name, the brand of the product and being lazy about it and just try to sell it at a lower price to make profit. And also, I am also a creator of a few goods and I think I would be upset if someone sells my goods for a low price.

I think there are many people who still use the handwritten for communication. I think the people who prefer handwritten letters want to show the true feeling when they hold the pen and write a letter. Maybe I think social media will not show the true emotion than handwritten maybe. Also, handwritten is the famous communication when I was a child. In that time, we didn't have any social media to chat, to talk, or to play. So we just had a hand written to send to the person you like, you miss, or you love. So I think it's a traditional way to express the feeling and I think it's very cute for the couple if they still use it in the current life. Maybe there are many ways to communicate without accepting handwritten such as mobile phones, emails, social network websites. I think the more development society has, the more people use the network to communicate. I think in the future people will use the mobile phone to chat to each other more and more. Because on the mobile phone you can use emails, you can use Facebook or other apps that you can contact with everyone you want.

In my family, my sister is the most targeted person. She talks the most in our family and most of the time, she has a history with the numerous member of the family who can bring these happily for our family. So, I do not agree with the topic that men often talk about more than a person. Men tend to have a tendency to talk more about cars, houses, and career more than women. In January and fourth American case, the women often talk about their home or their children instead of men talk about. For the games, I often played board games with my friends. It is a card to broaden my mind and I in this town can let my hair down and also can cheer with my friends about it when playing this game. I appreciate both. The team game will give me the ethnic to collate with the others while the individual game will provide me a chance to improve my attention and my skills and also my starting knowledge to join the game.

The first thing I do is called sharing and caring. It's when I give the things that I no longer need to the people who need it more than me. After school activities is also a good way for students to do time management. They have to balance the activities between at home and at school. At school, they have to learn more lessons, more skills. Whenever in-house, they should have their parents to do house chores and do homework. To encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities, the school can give them some of the qualifications, some of the certificates to prove that they already have joined the activities. That kind of certification is very important for students who will go abroad or who apply for the scholarship in the university. As I said, it's also a good chance for them to connect with other friends, to make new friends and also can help them to build a relationship that can help them to have them if they need anything after the extracurricular activities at school.

I think that the school student get some benefit for the lunch in the school canteen. The first one is cheap. That means when you take some food from your home, that much more expensive. And that is more convenient. Because after lunch, you may take some course and when you take your lunch in the school canteen, you can easy to access your classroom to take your course. So in other words, we can take some time savings for the school student to take your lunch in the canteen. And of course, that is the benefit. However, that is some inconvenience or something disadvantage when the student takes lunch in the school canteen. The first one item is that the menu of the canteen eat on whiteboard. That repeat some meat in the canteen every day and that makes the student more boring to take lunch in the school canteen. The second one is that there is some not very clean. There is some sanitary problem in the school canteen. So when you take your plate in the canteen, you should take care about the problem of the sanitary and there is some student is not very very comfortable with this kind of plate in the canteen. So what is the most objective can we do for the canteen? I think that is the reaction change. First thing we have to update the menu of the canteen because now the student can eat the canteen together and we can now very popular with the menu. And the time limitation to access canteen is maybe pose some problem. When the student access lunch in the school canteen, we must extend time and flexible. For example, some student want to get lunch at 10 am because he has finished all the course this morning and some other want to access later and we must flexible in the time table.",3

The children can share their issues with their parents. Furthermore, the parents can teach their children with love and responsibility. They can avoid their children from violence or something that is not suitable for their children. I think the parents can support teachers in educating their children via the teacher where their children do their homework, in home, or teach them many skills. In conclusion, I think parents are the best teachers of their children. Thank you. Thank you.",3

There are three options to use all my money as a rest like buying a new TV, deposing in a pint or spending on a short holiday. Now I will show you about my opinion that I will choose spending on a short holiday following some reasons. First, I think I need to let off some dream after a 20th day and I can enjoy this moment to the fullest and in the next time I can recharge my battery and feel full of peace to deal with many problems in the next time. So more importantly, I choose as I think I can is meditation and I can enjoy the silence and serenity and it's a great time for thinking to self-reflection. So I can feel terrible tech when never spending on short holidays and I think I will choose going a new location long. So that's why Chris. There are several reasons I don't choose other options. I don't think buying a new TV is suitable for me because my house has many TVs so you may be surprised but I have four TVs in my house and I think I don't need more buying a new TV. The posing in the blinds is quite good but I think it's not essential for me and it's not enough to dispose in the blinds and I think it's quite not essential. Both are profuse.

How has the reasons for people to visit a museum changed in the last 10 years? I think the reason for people to visit a museum changed in the last 10 years is atmosphere.

First of all, we can save the money for the accommodation. Secondly, the parents can help them to take care of their children when both the husband and the wife have to work. Because nowadays, one person can take care of six people. So maybe our life requires both the husband and wife to go to work to earn enough money to take care of their family. Unlike in the past, parents usually let their children grow independently and leave independently. Because in our countries, I think they have less opportunities to live indefinitely in the future. I think in my country, with the raising population now and the raising price of the accommodation, it's hard for newly graduated situation students can achieve. They can achieve for income that can afford both the rental accommodation or buy a house and even take care for their family and their children. It's really hard for a youngster to do it. I think the role of the parents is to help the children to live more independently. They should not have the mindset that they should and they must know how to take care of their own selves. Unlike in the past, nowadays parents take care of their children a lot. So sometimes children nowadays lack a lot of basic survival skills. And the role of parents. So first, educate the basic survival skills and maybe sometimes let them live in the poor so you can earn some to live independently. So they can boost their self-confidence and be more responsible.

However, the Internet Advertises have caused a lot of problems for the customers and even they had a lot of advertisements that we cannot concentrate on. I never bought something after watching online advertisements because I usually stop or get out of the Internet Advertises after watching them. Next, relating to the jobs and occupations.

For example, they had academic knowledge, they could communicate to the customers or even they could manage time and human labor well. That's why when we work with the youth box, we can learn a lot of things from them, even if they are male or female. In my opinion, from the experience of COVID pandemic in 2019, I refer to indoor jobs and outdoor ones because in the indoor jobs, you have many environments to learn.

So they can improve their skill like they can learn lots of languages when they communicate with the people come from the other countries. And I think in my point of view, the disadvantage of study abroad, so the people have to come to the new country so they have to spend too much time to learn about the culture in this country.

And when people, you know, the trust is very important for them. If you trust something, you can avoid the misunderstand and if you don't trust them, you can find it's very difficult to accomplish the duty assigned.

Because when other people, when the member in the team was assigned the discipline and they can definitely take responsibility for every task they get and they happen to run the deadlines or you can make it more perfect and when they do wrong, they, so kind of every people have to fulfill their duties and take responsibility for this task. And the discipline is a key to avoid some people work aside and they can work perfectively while other people who ignore the duties when the leader assigned or when the leader give and they can lose their proficiency as a team.

Some experts consider it sick and hurt, and also the very base of your immune system. More vegetables with variety from root, such as a carrot, such as beef, and to leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, lechesis, will bring you a lot of microbiotics, as well as vitamin ABC, ETC, which are very important for your body to function easily. And it's a very natural resource of vitamins and minerals, without being needed to intake from the tablets. Secondly, more homemade food and less fast food. Why people always talk about more homemade and less fast food? Because first of all, when making food by yourself or your own family, your mother or your wife making the food, you know how exactly the process is made, and you choose the most good for your health ingredients. Sometimes when you eat outside, the food is very tasty, but you can't know the process in which the cook makes your food. They will try to make more benefits by delivering you less fresh ingredients. They will use some chemical substance to upgrade the taste so you can enjoy the food. But this action can be very harmful for your health. Another thing I think of in order to have a better eating habits is consuming less carbohydrates, especially fast-food carbohydrates, such as white rice, white bread, and intake a large number of good proteins, such as fish, shrimp, squid, and good fat, which is most from avocado and a lot of nuts. Eating less carbs will make your body less bloating and also help you maintain your insulin level stable. You will not feel very hungry every moment of the day compared to people consume a large number of carbohydrates, especially fast carbohydrates. This is also a situation of obesity people. So answering the question, why should people change into healthier eating habits? Because healthier eating habits will make people stronger, healthier, and elevate the immune system.

I would have a stronger preference to accompany presidents. There are various reasons behind that. First of all, accompanying president is someone who have tried to the way of adversity. Therefore, they will have the experience in the hard situation. Therefore, they can give a lot of motivation to our members. And besides, accompanying president is someone who has a real success in their life. They have a lot of money, as well as a lot of grievances. So, they can be a huge example for our members to learn about how to be a successful person in their life. And last but not least, the company's love and knowledge is also the most important. Accompanying president can be the one who affects our lives the most.

He is the owner of VIN bus, the car that my parents used, and also the owner of VIN's home, so how I lived in.

First of all, for the famous singer, to myself, a singer is a person who has a great spirit and talent that the God gives them, so that they do not have to try and do not have to try so much like other kinds of jobs. Therefore, I would not like a famous singer. And besides, a famous singer does not have anything to teach us because to my parents, they do not really appear to matter too much in their life.

Therefore, an excellent student does not mean that they will be an excellent person at all, a successful man in the world. Therefore, it is really not the best example for our members to follow.",2

Husband and wife should have equal roles in the family. I think equal partnership is a hot debate topic which divides opinion. Many people of us think husband has more important roles in the family. I am in the favor of the idea that husband and wife should have equal roles in the family. Firstly, not only husband but also wife share more routine household tasks. Because nowadays, as you know, husband and wife always have their jobs. I think I am a female and I have a job. When I was a child, I had more time but now I am a co-president and winner. I always had enough time for my favorite doing. So I think routine household is the task for not only husband but also wife. Secondly, they have to share childcare responsibilities.

So the problem solving skill is one of the most necessary skills that I need to be good at because I'm faced with the trust and the talent of work at the office as my new job. So the problem solving skill I would deal with a lot of problems. I need to find the best suitable solution for that problem. But I'm not good at the problem solving skill and so I need to learn about that. About other skills is the language skill. As I said that I'm Vietnamese so English and my major is English but English now is just not enough. I need to study other, not only to improve my English skills but study other languages like Korean, I'm expecting to study Korean or Chinese to find a better job in the future. And about when students take off skills course, I think as soon as possible because not the interaction, the working or problem solving skills or language skills is vital to everyone. So if students study that soft skill when they were young they will have more experience, they're good at everything to solve the problem, to interact with other, communication with others. So I think as soon as possible. And about what I think about people learning about soft skill out of chance, I think I still agree with that. Please verify because you can still, the new thing is the best way to actually read your language. So in some case if you actually meet to solve the problem solving that you don't expect, so you learn about that, you know how to deal with that. So it's really good to you to know about the soft skill but not about the need. The other side is maybe waste your time but I still believe that in some case is have you a lot, maybe you not about yourself but you can share with everyone else, be surrounded. Thank you.

On the other hand, one of the advantages of living in a flat is that it's convenient. You can buy groceries, you can use the services. They are very near to you. You can use them to service you. But one of the disadvantages is that it's narrow. My dream house might be in a suburban area in Dalat. I want to plant some trees, have some dogs and play with them. It must be a peaceful place. My favorite destination is Nha Trang. I want to travel in my country because there are many sights and views I haven't visited yet.

As in my city, the private cars are banned in a certain time in a day. For example, the private cars are often banned from 6 to 8 am when the traffic is high. Or from 8 to 20 pm, or in the afternoon when people come home and the traffic is also quite high at that moment. But banning the private cars all day or totally in the city center is not a good idea. Because the public transportation is not enough to convey all the people in the city. In some emergency cases, the public transport is not fast enough or is not enough for people to solve the problem. For example, I live quite far from my house of my parents. I often visit them on the weekends, but sometimes they have problems in the week. They are sick and they feel not better and they are so serious. They call me and I really like to go as fast as possible to my parents. In that case, I love private cars and I know that other people will be like me in that situation. We cannot wait, we cannot be calm to wait. Public transportation is an emergency situation. Besides the private cars, I think we should develop very well the public transportation. In my city, I think the bus could be the best choice for public transportation. The bus can be organized very flexibly and it runs fast enough to transport people either way. For the fee of the bus, I think it is not to be free for all people. I agree with the method that my government is applying at the moment. That requires a fee for people from 18 to 55. The bus ticket is free for kids below 6 years old and for older people above 55 years old. I think it is a good way to help the government reduce the financial pressure for the government.",3

Students will be engaged. They can mix from learn and play. They can learn from entertainment and get fun from learning. Moreover, classroom games improve children's creativity. They will have more than one situation. Children can put their social skills to solve this problem. Instead of learning from one situation in the book, they can have so many different solutions to a problem issue. Last but not least, in classroom games, children have interaction with their friends. In traditional classrooms, there are no classroom games. So, the children need to sit on their own chair and listen to the teacher. If we hold classroom games, they can talk and get ideas from their friends, improve their ability to work in group, work in pair. So, in my own talk, the children should be learning in classroom games instead of traditional classroom. Traditional classroom maybe gives them more information, but they cannot learn, they cannot store in their mind for a long time. They can forget it after the lessons, but with classroom games, they can learn and play at the same time. It will change their mind. Maybe they will remember longer. However, classroom games also have some disadvantages. For some children who are easily distracted, they tend to talk about their own chat with friends. The private chats don't focus on the main purpose of the lesson. So, I think holding a classroom game is very useful, but we need to use it at the same time and at the same time. For example, with some difficult tasks, the teacher can assign a group to find the solution. Playing games with people about life. I agree with this opinion because in social life, children have many games. They can learn some social skills from this.",3

Firstly, when I take play at home, it's in the air in family and we can get closer together. Besides, it's good and suitable and we cannot pay so many.

Actually, I update news every day from Facebook, Zalo and so on. The source for my news updates is Facebook, television, sometimes Zalo and other social media. I think it's important to update news because it can help you expand your knowledge about information around the world. The second question is about the train. I traveled by train twice time ago. The first time is when I need to travel to Haiphong city to enjoy a trip. The second time is when I travel by train to Ha Long also to enjoy a trip. Train is a good service in my country because it can carry many people and it's cheap. So everyone can use train to commute around the city. There are many benefits of traveling by train. For example, traveling by train is a cheap way to commute. It helps people save their money. People do not have to spend a lot of money to buy a personal vehicle such as a car or motorbike. Besides, it also helps people save the food and course. Another benefit of traveling by train is that it can reduce traffic jam. Trains can carry up to thousands of people while a car can only carry the maximum of 5 people. So the more people using trains to commute around the city, the less vehicles are on the road. The decrease in vehicles can result in the reduce of traffic jam. The next time you travel by train, you can only carry a bus. The next time you travel by train, you can only carry a bus.",1

First of all, there are many kinds of museums, but I think they are evenly popular in my country, the art galleries, the museums, aura museum, art museum, tradition and customs museum, literature museum, air forces military museum. Nowadays children or students or teenagers, they don't really like enjoying going to the museum. Most of them go to the museum because it's mandatory for their studies or it's a mandatory activity in their school requirement. Probably because it's not accessible. First of all, it's not accessible, it's not widely known or introduced to the kids. With the development of technology and the rise of social media, we don't see much of a representation on museums and art galleries around here. Not much people talk about it, especially the KLLs, the key opinion leaders, the influencers on social media. They don't really focus on broadcasting about museums and art galleries. For that reason, it should be free of charge for students, should help them with getting real knowledge from the history, from whatever field museums were about. It's also a good place to hang out, not in the sense of talking or discussion, but in the sense of meeting new people, maybe not from the same interests, but same people of the same demographic, people who know certain kind of thing and where you can have an intellectual conversation with someone about specific topics related to the museum and art galleries. Also art galleries and museums in general can help you not just widen your knowledge, not just meeting people of the same interests, but also reduce stress. The activity of going to the museum itself is relaxing, it's not much like any other activity you can find in the shopping mall or in the entertainment centre. So it's one of the wonderful reasons why they should go, students, kids, children should go to museums and art galleries. And to be honest, free of charge or not, it's not one of the main problems that they are facing, but starting with no fee, no entry fee would be a really good opportunity for people to start to know more about museums. I believe that lots of countries across the world have done this free of charge, museums and art galleries. For example, in the United States, we have the Smithsonian organization, they are in charge of American museums and they do not charge anywhere at all.",3

So personally, I am not agree with this statement. Firstly, when we are talking about attending a collegiate for our university far from home for students, we must, we often think about home sickness. There are important criteria, but for me, in the modern life, when we have many kind, many material, many way of communication, the home sickness is not really a big deal. If we cannot meet our mom, our dad face to face, we can use smartphone, we can make video call, we can see each other every day. Not face to face, but via the smartphone with just internet connection. And then people think about the high living cost. Yes, that is true. When you are living far from your family, the living cost is higher because you must pay for the home, you must buy your food by yourself and it's got higher. But think about that. When you live with your family, you don't need to care too much to your life. Your mother will cook food for you, your father may take care about your motorbike or your bike, but when you are living alone far from home, it's up to you. You must take care of everything. You must know how to go to buy food, how to divide the food in the whole week. So you can go to the supermarket only one time per week and you buy the food, you calculate the adequate amount of food for the whole week. You know you have to learn how to manage your money by personal money management. So for me, yes, the living cost is higher, but you get many advantages just by spending little more amount of money. And then you cannot have another choice if you want to attend in the high ranking colleges because we don't have many high ranking colleges everywhere. And then about the dangerous life because when you don't stay with your father, with your mother, maybe the student will go out, they play with their friend, they drink, they eat outside and then they come back home very late. The problem may be that they are lazy and they don't want to cook for themselves. So they will prefer to eat out, they will prefer to buy the ready meal or cook the food. And we all know that ready meal or cook the food is not good for health. And then when they go out and they come back very late, there are some risks, there are some danger, but we can take care and we can control it by many ways.",3

And to do the project well, three suggestions are offered is going to the countryside, watching it on the internet, and reading books. I think three opinions like going to the countryside, watching it on the internet, and reading books are good. But in my opinion, I would choose going to the countryside is the best for several reasons. Firstly, I choose going to the countryside because I can enjoy the realty life of local people in here, and we can see and we can go and sightseeing of this countryside. And try to see and attempt to live like a countryside life of local people. And secondly, on the other hand, watching it on the internet may be not ideal since we can image the realty life of countryside like a flood, like a storm, like a harvest, weather changes. And I not choose that, not choose this. In addition, I would not choose reading books because it's just knowledge on paper. And we don't have knowledge, realty knowledge to do the project.

In my opinion, I totally agree with that opinion because of the following reasons. First, cheese is a good source of food. We can eat many plants. Vegetables are so important for our meal. It helps our digestive system work easily. If you eat vegetables, you also have a better skin. The other reason is that cheese also provides ooze for the countryside to cook. Because in many poor areas, they don't have an electric cooker. Secondly, cheese is so important to our environment. Cheese absorbs carbon dioxide and brings us oxygen to breathe. In reality, nowadays, air pollution is one of the most problems in the world. The air is polluted by means of chain sports, smokes, and industries. So if we plant more cheese, that means more oxygen is provided to our life. Besides, cheese also helps us to avoid disasters. Cheese also helps our world to avoid natural disasters such as food.

First one is that first of all parents can understand their children's strengths and weaknesses as they witness their growing up from a baby to adults. Secondly, parents when living with their children can form a close bond to their kids than others such as teachers or friends. The third reason is that with a loving heart and responsibility parents can teach their children different things from knowledge to social skills. Last but not least, as the children live with parents for a very long time in their life, their parents can set a shining example on a daily basis on good manners and behaviors such as picking up trash, respect to older persons, read books, and keep a green environment. It is widely believed that all the teachers need to teach but I believe that parents also play a key role in educating their children to support teachers. As several reasons that I mentioned before, parents got opportunities and understanding and love to educate their children and their roles have changed in Vietnam in the past 10 years. Many parents prefer homeschooling for the first 5 to 10 years of their children's life as they believe that those years are important to build up a character and to learn more like social skills rather than knowledge which their children can learn later on. However, the choice of careers of children lays on their interests, passions, and ability and I believe that parents can analyze with them to identify options but not intervene and decide for their children. Especially those interventions if conducted in the wrong way can break the good relationship between parents and their children.",3

And it is easy to bring it to the school. Because the fast food is very small and they can bring it very easy.

So working in groups by school has become a more standard way for students to learn. And they said that this way makes students become better. In my opinion, I fully agree with it. First of all, I think that studying in groups has students learn the good things, good aspects from other people. For example, studying with each other makes them more or less influenced by the other person. And if they are more influenced by the good part of them, they can use them to improve themselves. The other aspect is that they feel more likely to improve their communication skills. As we know, soft skills, communication skills, are the most important when it comes to work in society. Having done that in school beforehand will have students improve their skills more significantly. Because they spend up to like 12 or 15 years in school, which is a lot of time. With that much time, they can improve a lot of their personality. Moreover, they could be more active in joining the conversation themselves. They can create creativity to come up with their own idea. And that way, it's triggering their ability to stand up and stand their ground. And become more and more intrigued into the topic. But there are some disadvantages of working in groups. Some students, their rivalry is so high that when they work in a group, the tension is intense. And most of the time, some of the members of the group won't talk to each other anymore, although they were friends previously. This makes the AI more awkward between them and by doing their friend work. The rivalry in teamwork is also something that should be encouraged. Because eventually, when they grow up and work as adults, the rivalry is going to be in every aspect of their life. So, make them learn the earlier the better. And also, it's good for the teacher to take the loss as an open mind, so they don't have to think about it. The only way that teachers can improve their activities is by promoting and pairing students with random people. Every time they do activities, they should be with random people so that they can learn more about other people outside of their comfort zone.",3

I think dictionary is a bad way to re-ensport my learning and memorize the words that I need to understand the meaning of it. Usually, I prefer to use electronic dictionary for following reasons. Firstly, electronic dictionary can help me to search for the words real fast, rapidly, at a speed that using the traditional paper dictionary don't have. Secondly, electronic dictionary can provide more information about the words that I need to describe. Usually, paper dictionary only gives 1-2 examples of the words. While electronic dictionary can give up to 3 or 4 examples of the words that people use in the sentence. For example, for example, for example, for the word school, in the dictionary, it will explain the meaning of school and do it in a sample sentence. That is the way people use the word school in real life. I think dictionary is probably the most effective way to learn English. Because we can develop our skills like reading, writing, but we need to have a good vocabulary to be the base of everything. And, dictionary is the best way for us to memorize the definition. Whenever we come up with some words that we could not understand the meaning, we can describe the definition of those words through some proper situation.

A good teacher needs to encourage their students a lot, not only in their mental health but also in the way their students reach the knowledge. In my private fields, computers could influence teachers in the future. You know computers are just some mathematics robots. They are definitely not flexible in some cases. The teacher can do well. For example, when a student cannot understand which knowledge the robot is saying about the robot, they cannot ask the robot a question and the robot cannot give the answer all the time. The teacher can do well. Students obviously can ask for teachers to help them solve the problems. I agree with the question that a good teacher can change a student's life.

Everybody seems to be travelling since it is now more accessible to everyone. Travelling has many benefits, such as a way of making new friends or gaining knowledge about the cultures or helps you relax. Another benefit that I can think of is that it helps you change your surroundings and help you have a better view of your life before the travel. So about making new friends, I've been travelling to different places for the past couple of years and I have made a couple of friends along the way. I think travelling is a really good way to greet new people and connect with them since there's a lot of different aspects or different cultures that we can share and it seems to be a very interesting conversation. It's good to have friends other than friends at home. Besides making new friends, you can learn about the culture a lot. There's a lot of cultures, different cultures around the world and it's important that you do not neglect most of them because you should respect all cultures and learn about different cultures because it's very rich and you never know the person standing next to you could be from another culture and you should know how to behave around them or you might learn a few topics to talk about around them. I think for the most part, people travel mostly to relax and de-stress themselves from work and all of the stressful amounts of work counts. When you change your surroundings, you have a different view of your life. You seem to appreciate your life, your work or your family more since you get more perspective of how life from home and life from other places are.

The best thing that I really don't like is spending time with his grandparent in the countryside. Because you know that is good thing to see the grandparent but spend the whole time in summer holiday. I think it's waste the time that the kids they can get some experience in the summer camp that they will want to do. So I think the best thing to do in 3 choices is to have a summer camp. Because you know if you are outgoing you have something that you always want to you always look around to have the experience. And if you want the kid have the mindset good you need to do to well you have to let the kid have a lot of exercise and activity to improve their skill.

So I think raising pets will be good for the elderly in some points like that pets will release stress for the older so the older frequently the older you know country is they are at home alone or they are at home like in my grandmother and my grandpa they say at home together and have a pet with them can be if they consider our daughter a friend to them. Raising a pet can also increase social interaction like you walk your dog out your house or some kind like that and your neighbor also raise a dog and you too got some thing to talk about yeah they're social interaction and I think that pets were pretty well raised in my country and over like in overall pets in my country people loves animals so we have many tales and myths about describing the relationship between human and other animal like not just only dog it's about cats and even turtles too and there's a myth that turtles bring a sword to our kingdom we can defeat the inner virgin army. I think that raising a pet also give us a exercise partner so you when you walk your dog you also walk yourself and it can improve health of the elderly. I think that people will spend more money in pets in the future yes because the more than we are the more services and more methods of raising the pet properly and giving them give them a good health is appear more so to the people who do care about their pets I think they will definitely spend more money. Another beneficial when comes to the raising pets to the elderly raising a pet is that I think pets can be their garden especially like dogs they can be their garden, their friend and with the dogs around and guarding for them, guarding for their house and their properties with the younger fewer safer and like we can attention really easier for us to concentrate on our work and study when we know that there is someone in our house that actually care do caring for our grandmother and father take care of them",3

I think the factors that make a good park is that firstly is the atmosphere because as I mentioned about people go to parks to enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere there and to relax after hard working days so if the park is dirty and not fresh I think they don't want to be in the park anymore and the second one is the scenery in the park. A good park must have more trees and some maybe a lake which make the park cooler and yeah the benefits of going to the parks. The first one is that it will make us more healthy because we go to parks to work out, to walk and to enjoy the clean atmosphere and the second one is also a form of entertainment which helps us to lessen the stress and the tension after work and studying and the third one is that it would help our mental health.

Firstly, the Internet makes people have a real view of their lives, online, or living. Furthermore, they let fight-to-fight communication. In addition, the Internet got less privacy. Finally, in my opinion, in my point of view, I think Internet is with the Internet. If the Internet takes a number of their time, it means they don't have time for other real activities. I think a lot of people use social media, such as Facebook, TikTok, or the Internet. Because I think this social media is very attractive for more people. In my point of view, Internet changes a number of ways for people's communication. They will usually speak fight-to-fight, and now they only chat and send messages. They will send emails on the Internet platform. In my opinion, I think there are several different ways to use the Internet between Zhang and old people. The old and Zhang generation. First, young people often use the Internet for relaxing, such as watching Netflix, playing video games, and other things.

So other than the unreal life, less face-to-face communication or less privacy, I would like to mention the risk of cybercrime taking place on the internet. So I think this topic haven't been related much in Vietnam because people are not well informed or they do not acknowledge the risk that they could encounter when surfing the internet. So the cyber crimes could be identity theft, sexual assault or so on. So there are a lot of risks on the internet and even fraudulence a lot of people would actually like fake their identity and approach you and then they would like fraud you into sending them money without you knowing it's a fraud. So it's very dangerous for a lot of people. There have been real cases of fraudulence and identity theft in Vietnam, not only in Vietnam but also in the world. So it would be very dangerous and risky especially for vulnerable groups like young women or children who have no skills to defend themselves. There are cases where children are forced to send very sensitive pictures of themselves, sometimes nude pictures or sometimes pictures of them, videos of them doing very inappropriate things and most of the time they are blackmailed by those people to not tell their parents because they are afraid that those people could target them and they could find where they live and posing detrimental threats to their family so they just be quiet most of the time and this is very haphazard, this is so dangerous and it could cause a lot of traumas for the children and alongside with other people who experience this kind of blackmailing. So as young people it is important that me and my generation are aware of these risks and have actions to first protect ourselves and then protect the people around us. A lot of people just think that internet is the safe place for you to share your thoughts, to connect with people but it also comes along with a lot of risks as I just mentioned earlier and without any knowledge or skills it would be so dangerous for them. Yeah and it is true that the internet has changed the way people communicate drastically. They move from face-to-face conversation to conversation via texting or emails and even now with the prosperity of technology you don't have to meet a person in real life to know their face or to know their voice all you need is a electrical device that has camera and internet connection and you can see each other even if you're in Vietnam and the other one is in the USA so yeah",3

They may have an opportunity to work with them and talk with them and have the thinking about their life, study and so on.

First of all, obviously you can share with someone else. This really works because conversing or chatting or socializing with others or sharing your sadness while you are this way and maybe they can tell you some ways to deal with it or just either you can have a casual conversation and forget all about your sadness. Another way is to listen to music. Music stimulates your brain and of course there are sad songs but obviously you need to listen to uplifting songs more or more inspirational or motivational songs. Because listening to sad songs when you are sad is obviously not appropriate. So maybe you can do some exercises. Exercises relieve the stress and the stuck chemicals in your brain. It would help a lot when you become too sad or too sobby. There are some other ways that you can try. Obviously including entertainment in forms of films, Netflixing or simply go browse on YouTube or Facebook, Instagram, social networks to forget about it all. What are the sources of sadness? I think mainly it comes from failure. It is a consequence, a result of failure or a result in just having incidents happen in your life and you just don't, you're not ready yet to deal with them. Such as the loss of someone and when it comes to failure maybe a job application that you missed. When you are sad you may cry and that's a good thing. Crying just let it out and relieving the pain that you have inside of you. Holding it back just deepens the gravity of the sadness that you already have. What are the problems sadness can bring? Sadness mainly affects you mentally but mentally affects you physically. You feel down, you don't want to do anything.",3

There are three options at the festival, including providing more modern medical facilities, opening more private hospitals and clinics, and asking for customer feedback on the hospital's survival. Let's talk about both of them. In my opinion, I choose providing more modern medical facilities. There are two reasons I choose each, because each health people have a good quality treatment, moreover the cost of the hospital may be cheap, so that the resident of my hometown may be not paying the many fee for hospital. There are some drawbacks, I don't choose the other option for opening more private hospitals and clinics. I think each is the money, because the money will open the hospital and clinic is very expensive, and I think it is very good when opening many hospitals and clinics. Besides, when opening many private hospitals and clinics, there are some hospitals and clinics that are not ill, and I think it is very good when opening many hospitals and clinics. Besides, asking for customer feedback on the hospital's survival is not good, because many people don't like asking for the feedback on the hospital's survival, and they don't like each grant people are asking for, and they like keeping the secret about the hospital.

The benefits are that as humans we are social animals and to maintain social circle, which is our society, their collaboration among human beings is important. And when we help each other, we increase the trust and we can work and live better with each other. Also, to encourage young people to help others, I think we can include more volunteer work into their school's work and create more opportunities such as teamwork contest or give them more responsibilities for them to lead a group and to share tasks which they have to interact with each other.

I totally agree with this notion because of the following reasons. First of all, if you work with a group, or a certain group, you can learn from others. Specifically, in the group, there are a lot of people. Each member has certain skills, and they can help you to achieve their goals. Moreover, if you work with a group, you can improve communication skills.

Now, I will answer the following questions. Question number one, in my opinion, I think a group can work with a school whenever they practice or have some practice lessons. Like, for example, in English lessons, you can practice more and can work with groups in order to improve their language or listening skills. The second question is that I think besides some benefits of working with groups, there are also some disadvantages or team errors of working with groups. For example, in some cases, you cannot serve more personality in the groups or you have to follow by many people in the group. And the last question, teachers can do a lot of activities to improve the quality of groups. For example, teachers can support or can explain what the members of the group are not, students are not understanding, and they can explain for them. And teachers can support or improve their children, her children too.",3

Children will think liars are not that bad. Children will think liars are good for their life. And they will want to lie more and more and more. They will cover their thoughts with lies. And this will be a big problem for us. But when parents hear the children fall, they always get so mad. They judge them, hit them, and don't want to talk to them. That's why it makes children scared. And they will find a way to get out of trouble. Not because they are a bad kid. They just don't want the parents to feel sad. Children judge kids. Their minds are very short and they can't understand some hard things going on around the world. So I think when the children got some fall, don't judge them. Let's talk with them. Let them tell what happened and why it happened. Then you will decide what you will do next to them. You can get a little mad with them for them to know that you feel sad because they got that fall. But don't get things too hard. Because it makes things easier. You will feel sad so the children will not be able to fall in line again.

Because of some reason, it is the famous local in Hanoi. Secondly, Hochiming Museum is helping my class, which is very famous in memory. And learn about Hochiming. And I don't choose other reason by some reason. I don't choose sword leg because it is a solenoid and my class don't know walking around sword leg.

Firstly, self-study skills help us to be more independent. I mean, we can choose to study at our convenience. Anywhere we want, anytime we want. Secondly, it will help us to become better at time management by organizing our plans to study. Like, how many times we choose to spend on history task or how many times we choose to practice English, and so on. Another reason is that self-study skills help us to have a better academic performance. I mean, nowadays a great source of information is on the internet. And if we know a way to make the useful workpiece, it can be a great advantage for us. By having more materials as well as knowledge, we can easily get better grades. So I think self-study should be encouraged to everyone, especially students and post-graduate learners. Are self-study skills taught at school in our country? Yes, of course. But from my point of view, it has been not carrying a lot of weight. In a proper way. Like, I'm a medical student, so most of the time we learn at school as well as hospitals. And the time we have other subjects like us, life skills, should self-study skills be comparing at school? I don't think it's a bad idea, but I don't think it's good either. Because self-study skills depend much on a person. With his own decisions and own devotion to study, this will be advantageous in several ways. But if it is a comparison, I think it will not. Well, the leg-assessed skill chain affects student performance at university is that they can be shy.",3

I strongly believe that out of the three options that have been put forward to the local council, I think that the biggest or the best option that we could first look at raising is raising people's awareness about traffic laws. Mainly because if this issue isn't resolved, we need to help the public understand and also be aware of all the traffic laws, not let them hinder and go by misusing and just treating the roads as a raceway. Having them understand all the road signs, what they need to do what they shouldn't do and also enforcing more stringent laws on the road for drivers that will be penalized if they do not follow the rules of the traffic laws that they could be either fined or they could have a demerit system where eventually they would take away their driver's license. This would quite scare people and I think this would have a lot of people drive more carefully and this could help towards reducing traffic accidents and also people getting hurt in general. Traffic accidents even could be being just for example hitting a pedestrian or this could be like a fender bender, something small is a fender bender all the way to actually having a brutal or physical one-on-one accident. I think putting more speed limit signs around the city, I would say that is an option but that could come later. I believe that there is already enough speed limit signs placed everywhere. I think it's just the people not being aware that nothing will really happen to them if they do not follow the rules. So the only way as I mentioned is to actually enforce and explain to all the local people out there that they need to be more aware and follow the rules more diligently. Changing the driver's age limits I believe it is something that could also be done in the future. However I do also think it's quite unfair to the elderly as they also built the country and the city we reside on and if we take that away from them that would be quite unfair and also unfair to the people currently as they would see that that would be their future.

And also, I think the most important reason is that many students are quite lazy, so making these activities to be compulsory and the reason is that many students will encourage them to participate in one and improve their health and their knowledge. Well, in order to encourage students to join in more in extra curriculum activities, I think teachers and health masters from school should maybe give more bonus for them organizing more activities in their school like football or football competition among students to encourage them to practice more and in order to do that, they could maybe participate in these activities more. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",3

Secondly, to celebrate International Women's Day, we choose an activity often with women cooking. It is very searchable for this day because the women don't do anything.

Secondly, museums and art galleries can reduce the students' stress. Nowadays, the students have to learn many things in the school, such as math, library, literature, chemistry.

So I think in this situation, there are several ways to communicate to my college, to talk to her. Number one, you can write emails. Writing emails seems very formal practice. Sending messages also can be considered. If you are quite private, you can also send a good message. Talking in person among the three options, I think talking in person would be the best. As you know, social interaction, face to face would be the best option. I will start with talking in person first. Because everything, if we can, you know that the key of communication is the key. One of the key things to solve the problem is communication skills. When face to face discussion, I always think it would be the best and I will choose this option first. I want to tell her that, okay, in the office, everybody needs the image of our company. In office hygiene, we benefit from everybody. So compared to writing emails, I think writing emails are two forms. For this, it's quite a small ECU. Writing emails normally become very, very serious. Like HR will send some notification emails to some staff, very serious. And it's not very friendly way. Sending messages is also a good suggestion because it's quite privacy and key face to the person. However, the college is the person who works and meets up every day.

Invite her, go to a coffee shop and have a friendly and nicely talk and hope we can help the ECU.",2

The first reason is when the students contribute their money to the class fund, we will have a small amount of money that we can spend on the activities outdoors or the small parties in class. So that every student can have fun and they will love it for sure. Another reason why the class fund is a good idea is that it makes the students feel more responsible for what they haven't done. Maybe next time they will try not to do their exercises at home. Also, because the students haven't earned any money to pay for the class fund, they can get the money from their parents. As a result, their parents will feel more responsible and they will ask them to do some homework. So that they will be more hardworking in doing their work, their social chores. I don't think asking the students to rewrite the task 10 times works here because they may feel bored with doing the same things daily. If we require them to stand at the class corner for one hour, they may feel ashamed of themselves and the other students may look down on them. So it affects their own values or their own merit.",2

There are 3 activities to choose from. A Timberland Day, a Titan show and a Buffett wrestler. All 3 options are suitable. But when choosing among 3 options, I think that a Buffett wrestler is the best choice. The following reason. Firstly, Buffett wrestlers are suitable for all employees of small company. People need food to have energy to work. A Buffett wrestler has very very some food to choose. Secondly, a restaurant has employees in company are more close. They have more time to talk about themselves and to know other employees. I think Timberland Day and a Titan show are not good ideas.

Firstly, living alone brings the student a chance to be independent. By living alone, students can do whatever they want and do whatever they want without the punishment of their parents. They also need to arrange their activities, prepare the food by themselves, and taking up all the things a day. By this way, students can be more independent and be more mature than others who are living with their parents. So, living alone can bring the student the feeling of free. They can wake up whenever they want. They can do whatever they want, like listening to the music. They like eating what they love. When the student lives with their parents, they need to follow the rules of their parents. And sometimes they can't feel this feeling of free. Otherwise, living alone is a way for students to have a peaceful moment in their life. Each moment passes, they can't come back. In the modern life, students really love to have a chance to live alone, to know what is a peaceful moment without their parents' ears. Now I will answer the follow-up questions. The first one, living alone is not really popular among students because nowadays parents pay more attention to their kids and they need to show or to guarantee that their kids are always safe in their safety life. Some of the disadvantages of living alone is that when the student has some problem with their health, there is no help from their parents or their other family members. Sometimes besides the benefits, students may be homesick. Nowadays students live alone more than their parents' generation did because of their interest. They need to feel peaceful and feel free of life.",3

There are a number of reasons for my choice. The first reason is that actually when we adopt both a mark and comment during the process of learning for students, it will help them to receive constructive comments from the teachers and from their friends so that they can know exactly what is their strength and what is their weakness so that they can improve in the future. The second reason is that if we use both marks and comments during the process and also at the examination at the end of a semester in school, students can know what academic level they are in so that they can know exactly their performance. After that, they can choose their own talent and their own field or aspect they are good at so that they can grow their talent or their specialty in that field. Moreover, parents and teachers can understand their performance at school and can have some solutions or have some ways to contribute to their children and their students' performance at school. The reason I didn't choose the two best options is that if we use marks only and without any comment, the students can be quite confused that they don't know exactly what is wrong or what is good with their performance. On the other hand, if we use comments only, students can know exactly what is their academic level and what is their performance so that they can know exactly their ability.",2

And she is asking me about the punishment, about three options. As a student, do we write the starting time, do we write them to stand at the classroom corner for an hour? Or as a student, give some money to the classroom? If I were a student, I would choose requiring them to stand at the classroom corner for an hour. I think this is the best option among three options. For some reason, firstly, when they have to stand at the classroom corner, they will not have a chance to do anything without thinking about their mistakes. They can have an opportunity to realize their mistakes. Secondly, when they stand at the classroom corner, they can watch the classroom and they can see that my friend is trying to do their best, trying to study. This can make them feel guilty. And the next time, they will be better. I don't think asking the students to give some money to the classroom is a good option because it sounds economical and it's not suitable in the school communities. Asking the students to rewrite the starting time is not a bad idea, but I don't choose it. This way, the students can watch their time and they can feel that they have to write the starting time and they can pass the homework aside.",2

There is actually a funny survey about bullies, there is actually a funny survey about being bullied at school and they say that if the one being bullied knows how to react, they don't react negatively to the one bullying, then usually the bullies will get tired and leave the one being bullied alone. And then after that, I will definitely talk to his teacher because the teachers are responsible for students' well-being at school and the teachers are always responsible for taking care of my cousin as well as the bullies so they will have a better way of communication to not only my cousin but also the other students. Secondly, I will definitely talk to his parents, however, I will do this discreetly because usually I believe that children don't want their parents to know about their own problems if they aren't proud about it. Besides, if my cousin feels comfortable about talking to his parents about being bullied at school, then he would have already done so as well. So I would make sure that the parents will know about what is happening to their child, however, definitely try to keep it a secret between me and them. Thirdly and finally, I will not talk to his bullies. Talking to his bullies will not sound like a good idea to me because I will not talk to him. I will talk to him. According to a study in Vietnam National University, the bullies tend to have more motivations for his actions, for the victim if you try to talk him or her out of doing the bad actions. So that's for the above reasons. I will definitely talk to his teacher, talk to his parents, and just teach him how to react to being bullied at school.",2
