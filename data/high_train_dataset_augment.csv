They really like to enjoy the Vietnamese Chinese food. I often eat Vietnamese food on days because I am Vietnamese and I like to enjoy Vietnamese food. I think it's very good for my health and it's easy to find when I go out. My Vietnamese food is Pho Hanoi because I was born in Hanoi and I lived in Hanoi for 19 years. I love Pho Hanoi because it's the traditional food in Hanoi and it's very famous in the world. You know, people have their own restaurant in Chinese and a lot of people in Chinese love Pho Hanoi. I think Pho Hanoi is very famous and very good for my health. My family often go together because we want to spend a lot of time together. My family have four people. It's me, my father, my mother and my brother. I often sharing this because I love my family and I want to share with my friends about my family. My family's great thing about the garden is that it has a lot of benefits.","Okay, so I wanna talk about Vietnamese food, which I think is really famous, you know, 'cause so many international people visit Vietnam. They really enjoy the Vietnamese cuisine, especially the Chinese food too. I eat Vietnamese food a lot, like, almost every day, 'cause I’m Vietnamese and I just really like it. I mean, it’s super good for my health and it's easy to find when I go out.

My favorite Vietnamese dish is Pho Hanoi. I was born in Hanoi and lived there for 19 years, so it’s kinda special to me. I love Pho Hanoi 'cause it's the traditional food there and it's famous around the world. You know, there are even restaurants in China where a lot of people love Pho Hanoi. I really believe that Pho Hanoi is both popular and healthy.

When it comes to my family, we often eat together because we want to spend time with each other. There are four of us in my family: me, my dad, my mom, and my brother.

audio/HUST24223GHH9166/HUST2402230033-2.ogg," For me, I would definitely choose the company president to be invited speaker. There are several reasons for that. First of all, as a last year student, I would probably want to care about my career. And the last, and the company president is an excellent choice to make for the career advice. They would have many experience in the field that they are doing in because they are the president. They have the broad knowledge too. And honestly, even though it will not be as popular to other students as singers or excellent students, the president would provide real world experience. It would provide realistic approach to every problem that those youth are facing. It's probably not as fun, but it will be beneficial in the long run. If I was to choose a singer, a famous singer, it would definitely be entertainment. The famous singer is guaranteed to extract a lot of extension, even from other clubs. It will make our club extremely more favorable to other students. It will be good for the growth of our club, but it will not be as good for the club member itself. Especially, it's a youth club, so it's going to prepare students for a later career. So the president will be more appropriate than a famous singer in this case. And about the excellent student, yes, indeed he or she will get good grades. And he or she will get good knowledge and good experience of how to deal with school life and the field tasks, the tasks of the school. But he or she would not have the experience of a president who worked in a real life company before and had many years of experience in his or her pocket. Overall, I would definitely choose the company president because they are more knowledgeable, experienced and willing to share the story, to recruit some of our members.","Okay, so if I had to choose someone to invite as a speaker, I would totally go with the company president. There are a bunch of reasons for that. First off, I’m a last-year student and like, I’m really thinking about my career right now. So, having the company president come in would be an awesome choice for career advice, you know? They’ve got tons of experience in their field since they're the president, right? So they really know their stuff.

Honestly, I get that a singer or a really popular student might be more appealing to some, but the president would bring real-world experience, which is super important, especially for us young folks facing real-life problems. Sure, it might not be as fun as a concert or something, but in the long run, it’s way more beneficial for our futures.

Now, if I were to pick a famous singer instead, it’d definitely be all about the entertainment factor! I mean, a famous singer is gonna pull in a crowd, even from other clubs. That would definitely make our club more popular, which is great for growth, but it won't really do much for the members themselves. Since this is a youth club, we really want to prepare students for their future careers, so I think the president is the better choice.

And then there’s the top student—yeah, they probably have great grades and knowledge about school life and all the school tasks. But the thing is, they don’t have the real-world experience that a president has. That’s just something a student wouldn’t get from school, you know? So yeah, overall, I would definitely choose the company president because they’re more knowledgeable, experienced, and they’d be willing to share their stories and even help recruit some of our members.",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_1/audio/HUST24223GHH9166/hust2402230033-2.mp3,CD7_1,2
audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230055-2.ogg," Well, if my sister's classmates speak ill of her online, first I would need to know the characteristics of my imagination sister. She could be mean, and there's nothing to do about it, if that's the case. But let's say that she's not. She's really a nice sister. I think the best option is to ignore it. I mean, the silence speaks heavier, more heavily than words. You just live your life and ignore the rest. How about the three options? Deactivating her Facebook account. First of all, I don't think that I would ever have the right to interact with a sister's account. It's like prohibited, mostly. It's a no-go zone. How about deactivating her sister's, her friend's Facebook account? Not really a hacker, so I don't think so. Telling her teacher. I think conversations with teachers should be from the parents. Interaction between adults works differently. And also, it's not the ideal way to deal with bullying. Telling teachers will, you know, the teacher might have some say with those mean friends, and they just keep coming. The bullying won't stop. It's not a good solution. I think having the top of those friends might be the best out of the three, even though I'm not really... I'm kind of social awkward. I don't think I would have much the top of those friends, but it's the easiest way out of the three. Maybe I will be able to make friends with those classmates and turn them into my side. By that way I also have a lot more saying to my sister, because, you know, I have the hold on those friends.","Okay, so if my sister's classmates are talking trash about her online, first I'd wanna figure out what kind of person my sister is. Like, if she's being mean, then, you know, there's not much I can do about it. But let’s say she's actually a nice sister. In that case, I think the best thing is just to ignore it. I mean, silence speaks louder than words, right? So you just live your life and forget about what others say.

Now, what about the options? Deactivating her Facebook account? Honestly, I don’t think I’d ever have the right to mess with her account. That feels like a major no-go zone for me. Then there's deactivating her friend's Facebook account, but come on, I'm not a hacker or anything, so that's out too.

Telling her teacher? I mean, I feel like conversations with teachers should really come from the parents, you know? Adult interactions are just different. Plus, it doesn't really solve the whole bullying situation. I mean, the teacher might say something to those mean friends, but the bullying will probably just keep happening anyway. 

So, I think talking to those classmates might be the best option out of the three. Even though I’m kinda socially awkward and not sure I'd be great at it, I feel like it’s the easiest way to handle things. Maybe I could befriend them and get them on my side. That way, I’d have a bit more influence to help my sister out, you know?",9.5,9.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230055-2.mp3,CD9_1,2
audio/HUST6723KTLX177/HUST0607230212-2.ogg," Since I have three days off, I think I'm going to stay at home and go hiking with my friends since three days is kind of a long time. I chose staying at home and going hiking with my friends because I see that each of these activities have its own advantages. For the first activity, which is staying at home, I always have the feeling that I am a kind of a homebody. So I think I would spend three days in the vacation to stay at home so that I can relax, maybe take up a new hobby, for example, reading books and catch up on some chores. I find that my wardrobe has been really messy recently, so I really want to have time to reorganize that. For the last day of my vacation, I would like to go hiking with my friends since it is a 40-day activity. It can help me keep fit and protect my health. I also consider it as an opportunity to hang out with my friends and have interactions with them. For the reason why I did not choose traveling abroad, because I think I find that traveling abroad is very expensive and my current financial situation won't allow me to be able to afford that. And besides, for traveling abroad, I also want to have a longer duration of vacation, maybe like five days or a week so that I can stay there for a longer time and discover all the local amazing features. So to sum up, if I have three days of work, I think I would choose to stay at home or go climbing mountains with my friends rather than traveling abroad.","Okay, so I’ve got three days off, and I think I’m gonna just chill at home and maybe go hiking with my friends. I mean, three days is a decent amount of time, right? I picked staying home and hiking 'cause both have their perks. 

So first off, when it comes to staying at home, I kinda feel like a homebody most of the time. It just makes sense to spend those days relaxing, you know? I could dive into a new hobby, like reading a bunch of books, or just catch up on some chores around the house. My wardrobe is a total mess right now, so I really want to spend some time organizing that. 

Then on the last day, I’d love to go hiking with my friends. It's a great way to stay fit and it’s good for my health too. Plus, it’s a nice chance to hang out and connect with my friends. 

Now, the reason I didn’t choose to travel abroad is because, honestly, it’s super expensive. Right now, my financial situation just doesn’t allow for that kind of trip. And also, if I want to travel abroad, I’d want to have a longer vacation, like maybe five days or a week, you know? That way, I could really explore and soak up all the local sights.

So, to wrap it up, if I’ve got three days off, I’m gonna stick with staying at home and going hiking with friends instead of traveling abroad.",8.0,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_2/audio/HUST6723KTLX177/HUST0607230212-2.mp3,CD11_2,2
audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230012-3.ogg," Ok, so I will talk about the topic about Facebook. So there are three useful ways for Facebook as an useful learning tool for students. The first one is that Facebook is a means of entertainment. Because you can find many things that you want to watch or read on Facebook. You can find the videos, pictures in Facebook that make you relax after a pressure works or a pressure leisure or a pressure topic. The second way is that Facebook is an interactive way to learn. Because as you all know that in Facebook you can find such a huge library for you to research and to learn. So you can find online courses, online books in Facebook. And maybe they can have a short report for you to understand a process or procedure in Facebook. And the last but not least is Facebook is a source of information. So actually maybe the information in Facebook can be wrong or right. But it's also a source of information that you can rely on whenever you have to research for something. So I think overall Facebook is an useful learning tool for students. I am going to answer the questions. With the first question, I think that because Facebook is an online tool, so you have to face with many negative influences on its users. For example, it may contain some violence shots or sexual harassment shots that will be harmful for the children. Actually, with the second question, I think the number of Facebook users changed so much in the last 10 years in my country. Because in the last 10 years in my country, we have so many developments in networking for the internet. So Facebook is an online tool. It has a huge increase in Facebook users in my country. Of course, even though there are so many online tools such as TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and Twitter. But I think Facebook is still the main platform for people who would like to connect with their network. Or want to find a way to entertainment or just symbol to find a source of information. They also use Facebook so the number of users will increase in the future.","Okay, so I wanna talk about Facebook, you know? There are like, three really useful ways that Facebook can be a learning tool for students. So, the first one is that it’s a means of entertainment. I mean, you can find tons of stuff you wanna watch or read on there. You can check out videos and pictures on Facebook that help you chill after, like, a stressful day or whatever. 

The second way is that Facebook is, um, an interactive way to learn. 'Cause, as you all know, there's a huge library available on Facebook for research and learning. You can find online courses and e-books, which is pretty great. Sometimes, there are even short reports that help you understand a process or procedure better, you know? 

And last but not least, Facebook is a source of information. Now, I mean, the info on Facebook isn’t always right or wrong, but it can still be a place you rely on when you need to do some research on something. So, overall, I think Facebook is a pretty useful tool for students.

Now, I’m gonna answer some questions. For the first question, I think, you know, since Facebook is an online tool, you gotta deal with some negative influences on its users. For instance, it might have stuff like violent videos or stuff about sexual harassment that aren't good for kids. 

Moving on to the second question, I think the number of Facebook users has changed a lot in the past 10 years in my country. Like, we've seen so many developments in internet networking during that time. So, Facebook has really grown in users here. Sure, there are a lot of other platforms out there, like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and all, but I still think Facebook is the main place people go to connect with others or just find entertainment or info. So, the user numbers are likely to keep increasing in the future.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230012-3.mp3,CD9_1,3
audio/HUST30523GBJG166/HUST3005230081-3.ogg," It is said that school students should improve their self-study skills and I totally agree with this opinion because self-study skills have many benefits. The first one is that students can improve their time management through study. When they manage their time to self-study effectively, that will affect their ability to manage things better. Secondly, self-study helps students to move independently. That is a really precious skill that they can bring to their own hood especially in the university life when self-study is crucial. Thirdly, self-study skills lead to better academic performance. Research has shown that students who have better self-study skills would gain higher grades than those who do not have that skill and who do not manage their time well. For those reasons, I think that self-study skills are a really important skill to students and they should learn to improve that. I would like to answer the follow-up questions. Sadly, self-study skills are not taught in my country. Although we have self-study classes, we do not instruct the teachers and that time is thought to be the time for us to relax and not to study. Although self-study skills are necessary, it should not be compulsory at school because nothing is studied effectively through compunction only. The teacher should show students how important the skills are and how to make them feel relevant to that skill. The lack of self-study skills training affects students' performance at university as they cannot adapt to the huge amount of knowledge in the university. There are many things that are not mentioned in the lecture and students have to find it themselves.","Okay, so like, it's often said that school students should work on their self-study skills, and I totally agree with that because, I mean, self-study skills have so many benefits. The first one is that students can get better at managing their time through studying. When they figure out how to manage their time for self-study effectively, it really helps them with managing other things too. 

Then there’s the second point, which is that self-study helps students become more independent. That’s a super valuable skill they can take with them into adulthood, especially in university where, like, self-study is super crucial. And thirdly, self-study skills usually lead to better grades. Research has shown that students with good self-study skills tend to get higher grades compared to those who don’t have those skills or who struggle with time management. 

So, for those reasons, I really think self-study skills are important for students and they should definitely learn to improve on that. Now, about the follow-up questions—sadly, self-study skills aren’t really taught in my country. We do have self-study classes, but honestly, it’s more like free time rather than actual study time. It’s kinda seen as time to relax, not really to, like, study. 

Even though self-study skills are important, I don’t think they should be compulsory in schools because, you know, you can’t really learn well under pressure like that. Teachers should show students why these skills matter and how they can make them relevant. The lack of training in self-study skills can really hurt students' performance in university since they often struggle to keep up with all the knowledge they need to handle. A lot of what’s covered in lectures isn’t enough, and students end up having to figure things out on their own.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD10_2/audio/HUST30523GBJG166/HUST3005230081-3.mp3,CD10_2,3
audio/HUST281123C16D166/HUST2811230119-3.ogg," So exercise is like a fundamentals and of course very essential for one's physical health. So there is no doubt that exercise is good for our health. So one of the articles that I read before is about how physical exercise are better for human once they exercise it. I realized that in the areas that we live people go to gym a lot. They also have other activities such as going for a walk, short running or bicycling. However, going to gym are the most popular one. So going to gym has many benefits. Of course we are along with other physical exercises. So once you go to the gym, you don't need to be there like daily, only three days per week which are one or even one and a half hours. It can help you to boost your metabolism. It can make you sweat which increase in the physical levels of your heart rate and also it will make you taste better and you will have more endurance muscles. You have more strength and endurance in all your daily activities. So actually I think that physical education should be taught at all school levels especially at elementary and secondary school because that is when the children are being developed with their physical element and physical structure. So together with doing exercises, going to gym or even doing physical exercise, they will also be related to nutrition one. So in short, once you exercise you will have to bring your body additional supplements, vitamins, protein and especially water. You have to drink lots of water to compensate to what you have sweated. So one important key when it is being taught at school about physical education is that a student or anyone must ensure that the first they do not over exercise and the second they have knowledge of what to eat and what to compensate for the energy that they have lost during the physical exercise process. And the last but not least, the technique when you're doing exercise is very important. If you do it wrong you can maybe break your bone and I myself have been experiencing that with my back. So anyway, correct posture and correct technique are very important to train for ones to ensure that they do and exercise safely and correctly. So that one should be taught very carefully. I saw that in the gym many people pay for PT, the positional trainer, but after a while maybe some gymmers can teach each other how to exercise efficiently and safely.","Okay, so exercise is like really fundamental, you know, and it's super essential for our physical health. There's just no doubt that exercising is good for us. I remember reading this article about how physical exercise benefits people once they get into it. I noticed that in the areas where we live, like, a lot of folks are hitting the gym. But, they also do other activities, like going for walks, short runs, or biking. Still, going to the gym seems to be the most popular choice.

Now, going to the gym has tons of benefits, right? You don’t even have to go every day; just three times a week for about an hour or so can really help you boost your metabolism. It makes you sweat, which kinda gets your heart rate up, and you know, it helps you build muscle and endurance too. You get stronger for all those daily activities.

Honestly, I think physical education should be part of all school levels, especially in elementary and secondary schools. That’s when kids are really developing their physical fitness and structure. So, when they're doing exercises or going to the gym, it kinda goes hand in hand with learning about nutrition, too. 

So, like, when you exercise, you need to give your body some extra supplements, vitamins, protein, and of course, water. You really gotta drink a lot of water to replace what you've lost through sweating. And one important thing they should teach in school about physical education is that students need to know not to overdo it, and they should also know what to eat to replace the energy they lose when they work out. 

And then, the technique is super important, too. If you mess it up, you could really hurt yourself. I’ve actually experienced some back issues myself. So, having the right posture and technique is essential to make sure people exercise safely and correctly. That's something that should be taught really well. I've seen a lot of people at the gym paying for personal trainers, but eventually, some of those regular gym-goers can teach each other how to work out efficiently and safely as well.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_2/audio/HUST281123C16D166/HUST2811230119-3.mp3,CD17_2,3

It's a new Spanish restaurant in town. They serve lots of nice tapas so I fancy having some Spanish food and having a nice glass of wine. I just started a new job so I would like to tell them all about my new job and to find out what they've been doing recently. Besides going to the restaurant, I think I would also like to catch the new movie, the Barbie movie. I know the Barbie movie sounds silly but I've heard the reviews are good and I really want to see that movie and besides, it's a very girly movie and why not, right? So besides having dinner with my friends and going for a movie, I think I would like to also go for a walk with my friends, another group of friends. The weather is really nice and it would be nice to go for a nice walk with friends and have maybe a little picnic. I could buy some food or I could make some sandwiches and we could all meet up for a long walk during the day. So these are my options for the weekend, going out with friends, going for a meal and to catch a movie and to go for a long walk. That's my best choice. I would like to relax at home but I rather meet up with friends and relax with them. Right, the timer is still on. I'm not sure that I've got to keep talking.

People are just playing it all the time, like every morning and every afternoon. The football field is really the only place where you can hang out, and a lot of people enjoy that. 

Next, I want to say something about my neighborhood. So, I live in a big city, which means I don’t have many neighbors, you know? Most of the people around me are either older folks or kids. The main thing they do is play sports in the evenings and just talk and hang out a lot. I’ve been living in this neighborhood for a really long time, actually.

audio/HUST281123C16D166/HUST2811230107-3.ogg," Online shopping has become more and more popular in the modern societies for several reasons. The first reason is its flexibility in terms of time. As an online shopper, people can buy items or products 24 hours a day. Also, online shops have no time to open or close. So people can buy it, can do their shopping or do their transaction whenever they have free time. Another benefit of online shopping is the quick money transaction. Everything is done on the internet. The buyers can use their mobile phone to pay for the items they buy. As long as the phone is connected to the internet, it's done within a few seconds. The final reason for the popularity of online shopping is that it is easy to compare prices among the shops in the system. When you go online, you can open plenty of pages which show many kinds of shops. You can easily compare the prices and choose the best one that is affordable to you. However, there are some reasons why online shopping has become a future trend. What are some disadvantages of online shopping? Some of the problems that buyers may encounter when they buy online are that they may buy or purchase the imitating goods. What is written on the page or on the website is not exactly what they see or when they receive the products. They turn out to be broken or imitating goods if they cannot be checked in advance. Another problem with online shopping is that the buyers do not try it on before they actually buy it. For example, if you buy clothes online and you just see the appearance of the clothing items without trying them on, you will not know whether they fit you or not. What type of goods should be bought online? As I said earlier, clothes are the kind of items that should be bought online because you don't know whether they are your right size or not. I believe that people tend to buy online more because of the reliability of online shops.","Okay, so online shopping, you know, it's really taken off in modern society for a bunch of reasons. Like, the first reason is just how flexible it is when it comes to time. I mean, as an online shopper, you can buy stuff anytime, like 24/7. There are no opening or closing hours for online stores, so you can do your shopping whenever you have a bit of free time. 

Another big plus of online shopping is how fast the money transactions are. Everything happens online, right? You can use your phone to pay for whatever you buy. As long as you're connected to the internet, it's all done in just a few seconds. Super quick!

And, I think the last reason online shopping’s so popular is how easy it is to compare prices. When you go online, you can check out lots of different websites that show tons of shops. You can easily look at the prices and pick the best deal that works for your budget.

But, you know, there are also some downsides to online shopping. Like, one issue is that sometimes buyers end up with imitation goods. What you see on the website isn’t always what you get. When the products arrive, they might be broken or just not what you expected if you can’t check them out beforehand. 

Another thing is that you can’t try stuff on before you buy it. For example, if you’re buying clothes online, you only see how they look in pictures, so you really don’t know if they’ll fit you until you try them on. 

As for what types of goods are best to buy online, I’d say clothes are tricky because, like I mentioned, you can’t be sure about the size. But, overall, I believe people are more inclined to shop online these days ‘cause they trust online shops more.",8.5,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_2/audio/HUST281123C16D166/HUST2811230107-3.mp3,CD17_2,3

They have a good service, but one of the most allies I like the most, Vietnam allies. One of the benefits of traveling by train is by plane is it doesn't take a lot of time when you go to another places. As for me, English is very important for you because it's helped me to have a good job in the future. I also have so many chance to apply in the fortune company in Vietnam. One of the difficulties when I learn English is I think it depends on the age. When I was a child, it's quite easy to remember all of the new words or the new vocabulary, but when I'm a student in university, I mean, my age is more than 28 years old. It's quite for me and it's really difficult for me to remember the new word when you see it first. One of the important thing I often do when I want to improve my English skill and as for their listening English skill, I often listen or watch so many video on the YouTube channel, which is often my favorite video is about fashion or the economics. And as for speaking skill, I often talk with my friends every day at class and at my home. And as for writing skill, I often spend two hours a day to write an essay or write a newspaper, write an essay or write a solely paragraph when I feel upset when I feel when I don't have so much energy for the day.","No, I haven't traveled much lately. But I used to take the train a lot when I was a kid. I often went to Northern Vietnam. You know, I think Vietnam has a ton of airlines. They're pretty good, but honestly, one of the airlines I like the most is Vietnam Airlines. 

One of the benefits of traveling by train is that, like, it gives you a different experience compared to flying. But, you know, flying is quicker when you want to get to another place fast. 

As for English, I believe it’s really important because it helps me get a good job in the future. I've got a lot of chances to apply at top companies in Vietnam. But one of the tough things about learning English is that it kind of depends on your age. When I was a kid, it was way easier to remember new words. But now that I'm in university and, I mean, I’m over 28, it’s pretty hard for me to pick up new words the first time I see them.

One important thing I do to improve my English skills is listen to or watch a lot of videos on YouTube. My favorite videos are usually about fashion or economics. For my speaking skills, I talk with my friends every day, like in class and at home. And for writing, I try to spend about two hours a day writing essays or articles. Sometimes, I just write a little paragraph when I’m feeling down or if I don't have a lot of energy that day.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_1/audio/HUST6723H9GJ167/HUST0607230060-1.mp3,CD11_1,1
audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220060-2.ogg," So there are three options for my friend's birthday. The posting on her Facebook order, making a phone call or sending her a birthday card. So of all the three options, I think that the best option for me is to write a card for her. Because I think that writing a card shows that I put a lot of thoughts in my wishes for her and all the words that I write for her. And also, this is not common anymore, so maybe a card is more valuable than just a Facebook post which I can do every day. And another reason why I don't choose to post on her Facebook is because I think that it might be an act of seeking for approvals. Which I post on her Facebook just because I want everyone to see that we have a close relationship which I couldn't care less. And I think that posting on her Facebook might be a little bit showy. I tend to feel shine when I have to express my emotions on such a big platform where everyone can see my post. Regarding making a phone call, personally I don't usually make phone calls. I prefer text messages. And I think this is a trend for young people as well. So it would be rather awkward for me to make a phone call and just to wish her a happy birthday. I will struggle to continue my conversation with her through the phone calls because I couldn't find anything else to talk about. And it's a rather uncommon means of communication as well. So I think that all in all, sending her a birthday card would be the best. I would personally choose the best design of the card or I can even design the card myself. And that would show my attention to her and my consideration as well. And a card she can keep it for a long time as well.","Okay, so I've got three options for my friend's birthday, right? There's posting on her Facebook, making a phone call, or sending her a birthday card. And honestly, out of all these options, I think writing a card is the best way to go. I mean, it really shows that I put a lot of thought into my wishes for her and what I actually write. Plus, sending a card isn't super common anymore, so it kinda feels more special than just posting something on Facebook, which I could do any day. 

Another reason I wouldn't just post on her Facebook is that, you know, it kinda feels like I’d be looking for approval or something. Like, I'm posting it just to show everyone we’re close, but honestly, I don’t really care about that. It feels a bit showy, and I tend to get a bit shy expressing my feelings on such a big platform where anyone can see it, you know?

Then, there's the phone call option. Personally, I don't usually make phone calls; I'm more of a text message person. And I think a lot of young people feel the same way, right? So, picking up the phone to wish her a happy birthday would be kinda awkward for me. I'd struggle to keep the conversation going after that because I wouldn't really know what else to say. Plus, I feel like making phone calls isn't super common these days anyway.

So, yeah, all in all, I really think sending her a birthday card is the way to go. I can pick out a nice design or even make the card myself, which would really show that I care about her and I'm thinking of her. And a card is something she can keep for a long time, which is nice!",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD1/audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220060-2.mp3,CD1,2

In my opinion, among asking him to stop or letting him to continue, but under my control or informing my parents, I would like to choose the best, the first option, asking him to stop because I think that when studying in school, he should focus on studying instead of loving. When I fall in love with a girl, I think that it will make him more distracted and not focused on studying enough to earn the high grade at school. I think that after graduating, I think he should only love a girl after graduating school because after that, he will have more time to spend time with his girl and not affect his grade score at school. I think that to stop him, I can try to talk to the girl that he is loving. I can set up a meeting between he and his girl and talk to them that loving at school is having a bad effect. In conclusion, among three options, I would choose to ask him to stop.","Alright, so I'm gonna talk about my younger brother and this girl he likes in high school. I mean, if I had to choose between asking him to stop seeing her, letting him continue but with, like, my supervision, or telling our parents, I'd pick the first option—asking him to stop. 

I really think that when you’re in school, it’s super important to focus on studying rather than getting caught up in a relationship, you know? Falling in love might just distract him, and he could end up not paying enough attention to his studies, which is really important if he wants to get good grades. 

Honestly, I feel like once he graduates, that’s the time for him to focus on relationships. After school, he’ll have way more time to spend with his girlfriend without it affecting his grades. 

To try and help him out, I’d talk to the girl he's interested in. Maybe I could set up a meeting with both of them and explain how dating during school can be a bit of a distraction, you know? 

So, yeah, to wrap it up, among all the options I have, I definitely think I’d go for asking him to stop dating for now.",9.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230243-2.mp3,CD16_3,2
audio/HUST310232R9M177/HUST0310230287-3.ogg," Firstly, I think the idea of pets is wildly misinformed. I don't think we should be calling ourselves the owners of pets because they are helping us. Raising pets helps us to release stress, they help us increase social interaction, we have exercise partners when we have dogs, and we are never alone. Pets also help you with regards to your patience and your empathy. Dogs usually know when someone is sad or when to start calming someone down. Dogs are very good pets to have. Cats are good pets to have if you don't like a lot of responsibility. Cats usually tend to care for themselves. They bathe themselves and clean themselves and take themselves to the bathroom. Then they clean their own poop. You just have to scoop out the litter box with regards to birds. They are super noisy but also very easy I guess unless you are taking them out of the cage and they poop everywhere. But super easy though. Raising pets shouldn't be seen as something that is to be taken lightly. It should be something that is considered an honour. You should be seen as the watcher or the guardian of that life. You shouldn't be seen or portrayed as the owner of that life. You can't own a life. Anyway, I'm from South Africa so pets in my country that are popular are mainly dogs. Dogs and birds. It depends on person to person. Some people like horses, some people like wild game. Here in Vietnam I suppose dogs and cats are more popular as they are seen as some... you know... sometimes I guess not in all homes. In some homes pets are seen as a status thing I guess. In South Africa I guess everywhere in the world there are pets that are raised well and some people who don't raise their pets well. I think in South Africa mainly the majority of people try to be kind and caring with their pets and try to raise them well but due to the financial instabilities it's hard to make sure that they get everything they need. Whereas in Vietnam and Asia people don't have a lot of regards to life that isn't human so nothing gets raised well here. Now I think people will spend less money on pets in the future because they'll have less money because the world is busy ending so pets are probably going to become irrelevant in a while if we don't go back to like hunting them like wolves and stuff. But I don't think there will be a lot more money to spend on anything very soon. I hope we can still keep our dignity and take care of the pets like they are living beings.","Okay, so first off, I think the whole idea of pets is really misunderstood, you know? Like, we shouldn’t even call ourselves ""owners"" of pets because they do so much for us. I mean, raising pets helps us relieve stress, they boost our social interactions, and if you have a dog, they can be your exercise buddy. Plus, they make sure we’re never lonely. 

Pets also teach us about patience and empathy. Like, dogs, for instance, often know when someone is feeling down and they can help calm them down. They’re just really good companions. And then there’s cats; they’re awesome if you don’t want a lot of responsibility. Cats pretty much take care of themselves, right? They groom themselves, use the bathroom on their own, and you just need to scoop out the litter box. 

As for birds, yeah, they can be noisy but they’re pretty easy too, unless you’re taking them out of their cage and they make a mess, which can happen. Anyway, raising pets shouldn’t be a casual thing. It should be seen more like an honor, you know? You’re more like a guardian of that life instead of an owner. I mean, you can’t really own a life.

So, I’m from South Africa, and there pets are mostly dogs and birds. But it really depends on the person. Some people like horses, others prefer wild game. I think here in Vietnam, dogs and cats are more popular, but sometimes they’re viewed as a status symbol, you know? It’s not the same in every household.

In South Africa, generally, most people try to take good care of their pets, but sometimes financial struggles can make it tough to give them everything they need. In Vietnam and parts of Asia, it seems like there’s less regard for non-human life, so pets often don’t get the best care.

Looking ahead, I think people might spend less on pets in the future because money is getting tighter. You know, with everything going on in the world, pets could easily become less of a priority if things keep changing. But I really hope we don’t lose our dignity and can still care for pets like they’re living beings, 'cause they really deserve that.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M177/HUST0310230287-3.mp3,CD15_3,3

And once blue mooned I can go to the theater where I can enjoy the newest movie of the Hollywoods and I really enjoy living in a big city. And to be honest I think that the West Lake is the best place for visitors because it has many bars and many parks so that people can come and enjoy their days. Moreover the air there is very fresh and in the morning people can jog around West Lake and enjoy the very healthy air there. Another reason why visitors should visit West Lake is that it has many other foreigners so they can easily make friends from either the people who come from their country or the people who come from different country. And I will live here for the rest of my life. Why? Well it's because of the aforementioned facts that I have mentioned.

I usually say hello to them or in big occasions like my birthday party or their birthday party, we usually give each other best wishes. So yeah I think it's safe to say that I am getting along really well with my neighbors. To mention the fact that they are really helpful, I think that they do, they are always there in my times of need. For instance when I need a chicken for my soup, they bought me a chicken freely, although to be honest I really did not expect that.","Okay, so, I'm a person who lives in this big city, and to be honest, I live in the capital of Vietnam, which is Hanoi.

Okay, so first, if my younger brother is in love with a girl at school, I have to say I am worried. I am going to be worried. I don't have a brother, a younger brother, younger ones, but if I have a younger ones, I have to ask him to stop. And why? Because he needs to focus on school more than going out with other girls, yeah? Or I need to let him continue, but under my control. This is kind of a nice one because if I can use it... Okay, so firstly, for his bad, for his goodness, I have to say that if I control him, like if you want to go out with your girls, you have to study. And then I will allow you to go out with the girls. And maybe that is a good thing on him. Or maybe I can use it as his weakness. Or maybe I can force him to do things that he doesn't like, like washing my feet, or like helping with massaging my body or my shoulders. Yeah, I can use it as a weakness to control him. Or maybe I should inform parents because they've been through it. They know it all along. Love is a thing that all we go through, yeah, I went through, I'm sorry. So, which should I choose? I'm sorry for saying beating around the bush, but I'm going to... Firstly, I will tell my parents in secret, especially my mother because my mother is quiet. She will not say a sound about a secret. I tell her. She's not a spill the beans thing. She's not a spill the beans girl. So I will tell her and ask her for some suggestions of how to deal with this. Because parents maybe from afar, maybe like they are from the different generation with us, so they can say something that shouldn't be said. And my youngster, yeah, he's a teenager, so he can go up the wall and do some crazy things. Yeah. So, I think love shouldn't be forbidden. So asking him to stop is a no and letting him continue but under my control is a yes. But still, I will ask my mother for like some love suggestions, yeah, some love information so that I can add it and help my brother with his best.","Okay, so, love is definitely a thing in our universe, and it’s, like, a lovely thing, you know? But, if my younger brother fell in love with a girl at school, I’d have to say I’d be worried, right? I don’t actually have a younger brother, but if I did, I'd probably ask him to maybe chill on that and focus on school. You know what I mean? I mean, school is super important, way more than dating, yeah?

But then again, maybe I’d let him keep dating, but, like, under my control. That could be a nice way to handle it, yeah? Like, I’d say, ""If you wanna go out with your girl, you gotta make sure you’re keeping up with your studies first."" So, it could work out for him, you know? I could actually use his crush as motivation.

But then, there’s also the idea of using it as leverage, like, if he wants to hang out with this girl, he might have to do some chores or something for me, right? Like, maybe help out around the house or massage my shoulders or whatever. Haha, that could be a funny way to control him!

And I’d probably let our parents know about it, too, especially my mom. She's really good with secrets and won't spill the beans. I know she’d have some solid advice on how to deal with it. Parents have been through this stuff before, so they kinda know what’s up. 

Honestly, though, I think love shouldn't really be forbidden. So telling him to stop is a definite no. Letting him continue, but with my watchful eye, is a yes for sure.

audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230253-3.ogg," Okay, so let's talk about some several disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos. We do know animals are now, many species are endangered and they may be extinct if we are not protected. And so we think of a solution to the endangered species is that keeping them in the zoos. However, it do have pros and cons of this work. So let's talk first about the disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos. So firstly, I think keeping them in zoos may lead to the loss of freedom and they may be, yes, forget the natural habitat. For example, tiger do not know how to hunt the animals or hunt their prey. Instead of that, every day they are feeding their feet, they are feeding with the meat or with the meat, the pork, the beef and so, yeah, they will forget how to hunt the prey. The second one, I think the zoos is just our construction, it's not the natural, so it's not the nature, so it will like up space. For example, the monkey usually jump in the jungle, right? But in the zoos, maybe the space will be limited. So it's kind of inconvenient for the animals, I think. And as I mentioned about the tiger, the example, they do not know how to hunt the prey and it also leads to the lack of survival skills. For example, maybe in some case, they do not know or forget the way to fight back the animals who attacked them. And I think keeping animals in zoos also make us, also cost a lot of money and yes, it makes the animals forget about their natural habitat. However, keeping animals in zoos also have some advantages. So firstly, I think is that they are safe. They are safe and they are protective and they are protected. And they can maintain their species, they are not extinct from the world. And we, the people can see them while we are visiting the zoos, we can see the wildlife, how they look like instead of just looking at the pictures on the internet or in the book. Okay, so for the follow up questions, I will answer the three of them. So I think the animals usually kept in zoos are the endangered species like tiger or monkeys. The benefits of keeping animals in zoos I have mentioned above and people do to protect a wildlife species.","Okay, so let’s talk about some of the disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos. We all know that many animal species are now endangered, and if we don’t protect them, they could go extinct. So, when we think about solutions for these endangered species, keeping them in zoos seems like an option. But, you know, there are definitely pros and cons to this approach. 

So, first off, I think one big disadvantage is that keeping animals in zoos can lead to a loss of freedom. Like, they might forget their natural habitats. For instance, a tiger that’s in a zoo may not know how to hunt for its prey anymore. Instead, they’re just fed meat every day, like pork or beef, and yeah, they might completely forget how to hunt. 

Then there’s the fact that zoos are human-made constructions, and they’re not natural spaces. This can lead to limited room for the animals. Like, monkeys usually jump around in the jungle, right? But in a zoo, their space is often kinda small, making it inconvenient for them. 

And going back to the tiger example, if they don’t know how to hunt, they also might forget survival skills. For example, they could forget how to defend themselves against other animals that might attack them. Plus, keeping animals in zoos costs a lot of money and further disconnects them from their natural habitats.

But, you know, it’s not all bad. There are some advantages to keeping animals in zoos, too. For one, they can be safe and protected there. This can help maintain their species so they don’t go extinct. And, when we visit the zoos, we get to see wildlife up close instead of just looking at pictures online or in books. 

Okay, so for the follow-up questions, I’d say that the animals usually kept in zoos are often endangered species, like tigers or monkeys. The benefits of keeping them in zoos, as I mentioned, are about protecting wildlife and helping to maintain their species.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_3/audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230253-3.mp3,CD13_3,3

They often feel lonely and stressed, and having a pet can be a great way to help relieve that stress after a tough day of work. I mean, when you’re feeling down, a pet can really brighten up your mood right away. 

Also, having a pet can really boost our social interactions. Like, if we join a pet club, we get to meet a lot of new people and build new relationships, and that definitely has a positive effect on our social life. Plus, it helps us improve social skills, like communication and just connecting with others, you know?

And I also think that pets make great exercise partners. They can help you get outside and be active, and in return, you take care of them and share your life with them. This connection can really help reduce feelings of loneliness and maybe even avoid some negative impacts on mental health. 

In my opinion, raising a pet also helps people grow up to be more mature and independent. When you take care of a pet, you learn how to look after something other than yourself, which can make you more sympathetic toward others too. It’s a great way to prepare for a better life, I think.

As for what pets are popular in my country, I’d say cats and dogs are definitely at the top of the list. They’re just so cute and adorable, and people love animals that are soft, you know? Plus, having a cat can help catch mice, so they definitely have their benefits!

I really feel like pets are well taken care of in my country. Sure, some folks have pets just as companions, while others might raise them for food. But in general, I believe people are becoming more willing to spend money on their pets nowadays. They realize that pets not only support our mental well-being but also help people become more caring and responsible.

This is because you can't reconstruct your home because you just decide the space before you buy them. And it depends on the managers or the boss of this project. So we can't change the space. And secondly, maybe the problematic neighbors can affect to your atmosphere when you're living here. For some reason, just like rubbish or the noise because the apartment is, you know, closer and the space between a house is... we lack of the distance and the space between two houses. So you can be affected by the noises of the neighbors, of your neighbors. And sometimes the children of that house playing and running around the floor. So that will be a big problem if you consider to live in apartment. And last but not least, I think is pet restrictions. Pet restrictions is also a, you know, considered problem because this is the rule of some apartments that you cannot grow your pet in your house. So that will be a matter of great concern for some people who are pet lovers. Okay, so I believe that there are still many troubles when people want to live in apartment. But I think that in my country nowadays, people are still living in a house. Besides many young generation, they love living in apartment for the, you know, useful facility, convenient facility like supermarket or gym or swimming pool like that. And I think it's also a big advantages of living in apartment because you can access with this facility easier than living in a house who are sometimes far away, stay far away from these buildings or constructions. People living place in the 50 years, yes, definitely different from now. They become live in, you know, other space.","Okay, so living in an apartment is definitely tempting, right? It’s like this new trend that's become really popular among a lot of generations in my country and even worldwide. But, you know, I think there are some drawbacks to living in these kinds of places. 

First off, there’s the limited space. Like, you can’t really change your home around because you’ve already decided on the space when you buy it, and it kind of depends on the managers or the builders of the project, you know? So that means we can't really make any changes to that space.

Then, there’s the issue with neighbors. Sometimes, you can have problematic neighbors, and that can totally affect your living atmosphere. Like, it could be because of rubbish or noise. Since apartments are so close together, the lack of distance between homes can mean you really hear your neighbors. You might have kids running around or playing loudly, and that could be a big issue if you think about living in an apartment, for sure.

And last but not least, there's pet restrictions. A lot of apartments have rules that don’t allow pets, which can definitely be a big concern for pet lovers, you know? 

So yeah, I really do believe there are still many issues when people think about living in an apartment. But in my country right now, I think a lot of people still choose to live in houses. However, many young people love living in apartments because of the, you know, convenient facilities like supermarkets, gyms, or swimming pools. That’s a big advantage of apartment living, since you can access those facilities a lot easier than if you're living in a house that might be far away from those places.

I mean, the way people live now is super different from 50 years ago. They’re more into living in different types of spaces.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF166/HUST3110230202-3.mp3,CD16_3,3

My favorite subject is literature because I usually read the literature books. I am very excited with how we study literature. Is that a subject popular in your country? Yes, it is. Because the literature is one of the subjects the student must study for the final exam. It is very important. Do you get on well with your classmates? Yes, I do. My classmates are one of the best friends in the school. Now let's talk about time. Are you good at managing your time? No, I am not. I am very bad at managing my time. I always feel the pain I want to do. How do you manage your time? I usually plan in the morning. I will write a note in one book or in the computer. After that I will do anything in the note.

Yeah, it is. Literature is one of those subjects that students really have to study for their final exams, so it’s super important. Do you get along well with your classmates? 

Yes, I do! My classmates are some of my best friends at school. 

Alright, now let’s talk about time. Are you good at managing your time? 

Honestly, no, I’m not. I’m really bad at managing my time. I always feel the pressure of stuff I want to get done. How do you usually manage your time? 

Well, I usually plan my day in the morning. I’ll write notes in a book or on my computer. After that, I just try to follow what’s on my list. I make sure to note down what’s most important for me to do. I think the morning is the best time for me to manage my tasks.

So underlying this choice, certain reasons. So the first reason is that although flowers are something really fragile, which means they can go off in just after a few days. Anyway, they undoubtedly have the essence of the beauty of nature and this is commensurate with our love for my guardians. Secondly, when we choose the bulkhead of flowers as a present, we also have the ability to include a hand made card as an attachment. So this choice of present is not really a choice that is very multifunctional. And the final reason for my choice is that my mom, she really loves flowers. Every time she goes to the local market, she always brings home a handful of floral plants that she can put in a vase to embellish our living room. So it can be said that she has a kind of familiar ride herself with most of the local flowers. So I'm thinking of including some exotic flowers like Japanese Sakura as a special embarrassment in my pluckets of flower.","Okay, so like, when I think about gifts for my parents’ wedding celebration, I've got three options, but I'm totally leaning towards a bouquet of flowers. There are a few reasons for that. 

First off, you know, flowers might be pretty fragile and they don’t last super long—like just a few days sometimes—but they really capture the beauty of nature, and I think that really reflects our love for my parents. 

Then, if I choose a bouquet, I can also add a handmade card with it, which is kind of nice. So it’s not just a simple gift; it’s a bit more personal and meaningful, right? 

And lastly, my mom really loves flowers! Whenever she goes to the local market, she always brings home some flowers to put in a vase and make our living room look nice. I mean, she practically knows all the local flowers by heart. So I was thinking about adding some exotic flowers, like Japanese Sakura, to make the bouquet extra special.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_3/audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230245-2.mp3,CD13_3,2
audio/HUST26922WT9V166/HUST2609220023-3.ogg," I think that Facebook is an useful tool for other students. First of all, you can find a lot of information on Facebook. For example, you can find jobs or information about your friends, about their hobbies. Otherwise, you can find a lot of documents on some studying groups that contain a lot of good students and teachers. They even can help you in your study. Secondly, surfing Facebook may help you to relax after a hard-working or hard-studying day. Otherwise, you can contact with your friends, chat with them, and share your own story. Finally, you can watch a lot of funny videos and images on Facebook. Last but not least, Facebook is a great tool to learn English. For example, you can add a foreigner as a friend and you can chat with them. And when you chat with a foreigner, your English skill is improved day by day. I think that the negative influences that Facebook has on its users is that it's really time-consuming. Recently, most people use Facebook. They just surfing Facebook and read the news on it. It takes them a lot of time. At that time, they can go outside and do a lot of activities that are useful for their health. There are a lot of cyber-willing on Facebook. For example, many people can make a group to anti someone and cause them a lot of trouble in their life by spreading the rumors about them. I think that the number of Facebook has recently increased a lot compared to the last 10 years. Because first of all, in the past, Facebook is not available in Vietnam. It's all English. Most Vietnamese people don't know English and they didn't use it regularly. However, nowadays, the rapidly increase of the users shows that Facebook actually cares about Vietnamese users. It's become one of the most popular social media on Facebook on the Internet. I think that the number of people who use Facebook will decrease in the future. Actually, there is a ton of social media, for example, TikTok or YouTube, which contains a lot of users. It's even more convenient. Some reports show that the user of Facebook is decreasing by recent years. In the future, it obviously will not increase.","Okay, so I think Facebook is a really useful tool for students, you know? First of all, you can find a ton of information on Facebook. Like, you can look up jobs or see what your friends are into, like their hobbies. And then you can also find a lot of documents in some study groups that have really smart students and teachers in them. They can totally help you out with your studies. 

Secondly, browsing Facebook can help you unwind after a long day of working or studying. You can reach out to your friends, chat with them, and share your own stories too. It's a nice way to relax. And then, of course, there's all the funny videos and memes that you can watch on Facebook, which can really brighten your day. 

Last but not least, Facebook’s actually a great tool for learning English. You can add someone from another country as a friend and chat with them. I mean, when you’re talking to a native speaker, your English skills improve little by little every day, which is super cool.

But, like, the downside is that Facebook can be really time-consuming. I mean, these days, a lot of people just scroll through Facebook and read the news for hours. Instead, they could be outside or doing activities that are actually good for their health, you know? Plus, there’s cyberbullying on Facebook. Some people create groups just to bully someone, spreading rumors and causing a lot of trouble in their lives—it's terrible.

Now, about the number of Facebook users, I think it’s increased a lot compared to ten years ago. I mean, back then, Facebook wasn’t really popular in Vietnam. It was all in English, and most Vietnamese people didn’t speak English, so they didn't use it much. But nowadays, the rapid growth in users shows that Facebook is really paying attention to Vietnamese users. It’s become one of the most popular social media platforms out there.

But honestly, I think the number of people using Facebook might drop in the future. There’s a ton of other social media like TikTok and YouTube that are super popular and even more convenient. Some reports have shown that Facebook's user base has been decreasing in recent years, so I don’t think it’s gonna grow much more in the future.",8.0,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD1/audio/HUST26922WT9V166/HUST2609220023-3.mp3,CD1,3

And for me to travel safely, I think we can use some tips like we can buy some insurance. We can buy insurance, especially for the travel overseas. We really have to buy insurance. And moreover, we have to get knowledge and to study carefully about where we will go and the best way we can travel or what kind of transportation, the kind of safe transportation that we can take when we travel there. Or we should search about the climate, where the climate condition of where we will travel and we can prepare best for our traveling. Like whether or not we should bring the raincoat or the jacket to there. Is it hot or is it cold? It's right here. The most popular destinations for travelers in Vietnam. I think many people in Vietnam now spend time on local destinations like Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, or some beach city like Nha Trang or Da Nang. It's a very beautiful and popular destination in Vietnam. Moreover, the travelers in Vietnam also spend time for some overseas countries, especially the countries that are near to us like China, Singapore, Thailand. Why do more and more people travel overseas? Maybe because they have spent time for holiday in so many destinations in Vietnam. So they want to travel more, travel overseas to know more about the other countries. Or they want to travel overseas because they are curious and they want to study or want to know more about the other destination, other people. Because when we travel overseas, we can meet foreigners, different languages or different religions. So it will bring a lot of new knowledge about a country. So we're curious and we really want to travel to another country to know more. Moreover, many abroad countries now have very nice policies on tourism and they have a nice destination or nice control, control of beauty. Like China, we have the Gom Thai or in Bangkok, Thailand, we have many beautiful pagodas, structures. So that's why, in my opinion, more and more people travel to overseas. Thank you.","Okay, so I wanna talk about traveling and why I think it’s really good for everyone, you know? It helps us make new friends, gain knowledge, relax a bit, and stretch our horizons. When it comes to traveling safely, I think there are some tips we can follow. Like, for one, buying insurance is super important, especially if you’re traveling overseas. I mean, we really gotta make sure we have that.

Plus, it’s good to do some research about where we’re going. We should check out the best ways to travel around, like what kind of safe transportation we can take. And don't forget about the climate! We gotta know if we need to pack a raincoat or a jacket. Is it gonna be hot or cold where we’re headed? 

In Vietnam, there are a lot of popular travel spots that people love. Like, tons of folks visit local places like Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, which is the capital. Then there are nice beach cities like Nha Trang and Da Nang—really beautiful spots, you know? 

But, a lot of travelers in Vietnam also want to go abroad, especially to nearby countries like China, Singapore, and Thailand. Why is that? Well, maybe it’s 'cause they've already explored a lot of places in Vietnam, so they’re curious about what it’s like in other countries. Plus, traveling overseas lets us meet different people, hear new languages, and learn about different religions, which is pretty exciting. 

And let's be real, many countries have really great tourism policies and beautiful destinations.

So, I think a youth club for your school, for my school, sorry, a youth club for my school, is having a workshop on life experience and I think that I would suggest that we invite a company president to be the main speaker to talk about his life, his or her life experience. And the reason being is that the company president, so I would say that we invite the president of a company who works mainly in technology because our school is about technology. Most students major in technologies and computer science, so it would be very beneficial for the students, for students in the youth club as we, most of our discussion topics also involves technology and computer science. And I think that by inviting a company president into the workshop as the main speaker, he or she can provide some career advice for students in the club and also because the president already gone through his or her student phase, he or she can provide the, and I think that he or she can better understand the experiences that some students might face and also provide suitable advices for them and I think the company president can also provide the working opportunities for some excellent students, some outstanding students in the club which can be very beneficial for, for example, senior, for the seniors or for last year students who are actively working for jobs. This is also a way to increase our connection. I don't think that we should invite an excellent student in our year because somehow I feel like they have not enough experience to share as a main speaker and it might not be convincing enough for everyone to sit down and listen to the same, to a peer student speaking for about one hour and I don't think it's very appealing to people. And about the singer, I think that it is also an interesting choice but might not be appropriate for this workshop because why we are attracted to the singer, the singer might not be like we.","Okay, so I think the situation is pretty interesting. So, I wanna talk about this youth club at my school, right? They're having a workshop on life experiences, and I think it’d be a great idea to invite a company president to be the main speaker. I mean, the reason I say this is that if we get someone who's a president, especially from a tech company, it’d really fit since our school focuses on technology and most of the students are studying tech or computer science. 

So, having a company president as the main speaker would be super beneficial for everyone in the youth club 'cause most of our discussions revolve around technology and computer science. Plus, this president, you know, they’ve been through school too, so they can relate to what students are going through. They could give some solid career advice and understand the challenges that students might be facing, you know? 

And, I also think this president could even offer job opportunities to some of the outstanding students in the club, which would be really helpful for seniors or anyone looking for jobs. It’s a good way to make connections too, I think. 

Now, I don’t really think we should invite a top student from our year to speak. I mean, they might not have enough experience to share, and it might not be convincing enough for people to listen to a peer talking for an hour, you know? It just doesn’t sound very appealing. 

As for inviting a singer, I think that’s an interesting idea too, but it might not really fit this workshop.

audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220002-2.ogg, so the reason I would actually choose a book because as for me a book is a very nice item to increase your knowledge as well as to have different perspective on life so yeah a book especially for someone who is doing military service they might have a lot of time alone when they don't have a duty or when they're in their free time then reading a book other than using electrical devices would be a much greater way to entertain themselves and to have a quiet and peaceful time. I think like many people would say that nowadays book are not that important and you can just read anything on the phone or on the internet but I think that is so not true because a book really gives you a different experience from an electrical devices. I really do enjoy the sensation of touching the paper of a book and then you can take notes whenever you feel like the information is helpful or you think that the message really resonates with you. My brother who used to do the military service when he was younger said that he spent most of his time most of his free time reading books and that and he never regretted that decision because it has given him a lot of time to to consider life in different perspectives as well as to learn different knowledge. One of his favorite book I cannot recall the name of the book at the moment but it was a book about the Nazis and how people were suffering in camps that were built up by the Nazis and he said that it was an absolutely life-changing experience. So that is one prime example of why a book is a very special and suitable gift for someone who is doing military service. You know like regardless of their position like even if they are just the first rank soldier or anything else the book would always be helpful like why would you not like knowledge right so yeah definitely a book,"Okay, so the reason I’d pick a book is that, you know, a book is just such a great item for boosting your knowledge and getting different perspectives on life. Especially for someone doing military service, they might have a lot of alone time when they’re not on duty or during their downtime. Reading a book is way better than just staring at screens, I mean, it’s a nice way to entertain themselves and have a quiet, peaceful time.

I know a lot of people say books aren’t that important anymore since you can just read stuff on your phone or online, but honestly, I think that’s totally not true. Like, a book offers a whole different experience compared to digital devices. I really enjoy the feeling of touching the paper and being able to take notes whenever something really hits home or resonates with me.

My brother, who did military service when he was younger, told me he spent most of his free time reading. He never regretted it because it gave him a lot of time to think about life in different ways and learn a ton of stuff. One of his favorite books—I can’t remember the name right now—but it was about the Nazis and the suffering in concentration camps. He said it was a totally life-changing experience.

So, that’s just one solid example of why a book is such a special and fitting gift for someone in military service.

And I’m thinking about what kind of gift I wanna buy for her. If she’s like my close friend, which she is, I’d definitely prefer to get her a book, you know? Not just any book, but something that’s really meaningful. Like, I’m thinking about a book that offers a lot of knowledge—maybe something like “Think and Grow Rich” or a book on marketing or starting a business. I know she’s going to a developing country, and honestly, those places can have a ton of opportunities. 

If she ever wants to start her own business in the future, that kind of book is really going to help her a lot. I mean, with books, you gain so much knowledge when you read, you know? And the great thing about books is they last forever. 

Now, if I were to think about things like a backpack or beauty products—sure, those are nice—but they don’t really last as long. Like, a backpack might only be good for a year, and then you have to replace it if it gets old or torn. And beauty products? Well, when you get into a new country, they might not even fit your skin type, and then they’re just gone, you know?

So, I really wanna get her something that’s actually gonna last a long time—like for years—and that’ll remind her of our friendship whenever she reads it. Long-lasting gifts are the way to go!",8.5,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230211-2.mp3,CD15_3,2
audio/HUST311023PTXC166/HUST3110230118-2.ogg," So I heard that you have a plan to visit a city in Vietnam during your summer vacation. And your choice, there are 3 choices, Hanoi, Sapa and Da Lạc. In my opinion, I think Hanoi would be the best option for you. Let me explain why. The first city, Da Lạc. This city might have favorable weather and a lot of scenic views. But the cost to travel and to have the sightseeing here is now increasing. So if you are not stable with your financial ability, I think it would be better choice to choose the other city. But another perspective in my view about Sapa is that this city has not remained unchanged since 2017. Because the funding resource here has stopped for a while. So there were not much change since then. And of course another problem that resembles the previous one is that the cost for traveling and to taking the sightseeing in Sapa is also increasing. Due to the economic depression lately. But in Hanoi, you will find it easier to integrate and to have a more interesting experience here. You can have plenty of food, plenty of sightseeing, plenty of views and other tourist attractions. So that you can have good memo about that. Also, Hanoi was also very friendly and easy to hang out with. You can find the late night life here in many many many locations around Hanoi. You can take a tour in the midnight, you can have some beers on Tahiran Street, you can have some street food all around the city with a really really low price. So I suggest that Hanoi would be the best city for you to travel on this summer vacation. Thank you.","Okay, so I heard you’re planning to visit a city in Vietnam during your summer vacation, right? And you have three choices: Hanoi, Sapa, and Da Lạc. Honestly, I think Hanoi is the best pick for you. Let me explain why. 

First off, let’s talk about Da Lạc. It’s known for its nice weather and beautiful views, but the costs for traveling and sightseeing there have been going up lately. So, if you’re a bit tight on money, maybe it's better to consider one of the other options.

Now, Sapa is another choice, but honestly, it hasn't changed much since 2017. I mean, the funding for improvements has kinda stopped, so it’s pretty much the same as it was before. Plus, like Da Lạc, the costs for travel and sightseeing in Sapa are rising too, mainly because of the economic situation recently.

But then there's Hanoi! In Hanoi, you’ll find it way easier to connect with the vibe and have a more exciting experience. There's just so much food, so many places to see, and tons of attractions. You’ll make great memories, trust me. The people in Hanoi are really friendly, and there are plenty of places to hang out.

You can check out the nightlife in lots of spots around the city. Like, you could take a night tour, grab some beers on Ta Hien Street, and enjoy street food all over with really low prices. So, yeah, I really think Hanoi would be the best city for your summer trip. Thanks for listening!",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC166/HUST3110230118-2.mp3,CD16_2,2

Because it's probably because the first reason I want to mention is that in the autumn, the weather is so nice. It's cool and windy and it's perfect for sightseeing or going out. I can take my friends around the city and see things around the street. In addition, another reason I want to mention is that in autumn, there are so many delicious food in Hanoi such as gom or you can enjoy the food and eating it. I can take my friends around to taste the Vietnamese traditional foods in Hanoi. So I think the autumn is a great choice if a French people will come in Vietnam. In terms of the summer and the spring, I think it's not a good choice because in summer, the weather is not good. It's too hot to go around and we're always wet. We're always too wet to go outside. People tend to prefer staying in the airy conditioner rooms, especially for the French people who live in the cold weather. Another reason for not choosing the spring season is because in spring, there are some light rains and it's still quite cold for people to go around. So in my opinion, the autumn is the best choice. I think it's a good choice.","Okay, so if my French friend is planning to visit Vietnam, I would definitely recommend autumn. I mean, the first reason is that the weather’s just so nice during that time of year. It’s cool and kind of windy, and it's perfect for sightseeing or just going out. I can take my friend around the city and show them all the street sights.

Plus, there’s so much delicious food in Hanoi in the autumn. You've got things like gom, and honestly, it’s just a great time to enjoy Vietnamese traditional dishes. So yeah, I think autumn’s a really great choice for a French person visiting Vietnam.

Now, looking at summer and spring, I don’t think they’re great options. In summer, the weather can be pretty rough — it’s just too hot to be outside, and honestly, it makes you super sweaty. People usually prefer to stay in air-conditioned rooms, especially since my friend is coming from a place with cooler weather.

And then with spring, it can also be a little tricky ‘cause there are some light rains, and it’s still kinda chilly sometimes, which isn’t ideal for exploring. So yeah, in my opinion, autumn really is the best time for them to visit. I just think it’s the best choice overall.",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_1/audio/HUST6923V6BY166/HUST0609230010-2.mp3,CD13_1,2
audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-3.ogg," I think there are a number of reasons why teenagers learn to play a musical instrument such as the piano or the guitar. I think there are three main reasons as below. The first, if you want to reduce stress after a long day of work or study, for teenagers it would be a long day at school. You can play the guitar or the piano because if you listen to the lovely melody, the rhythm, you will be one with the music. You will be integrating your soul with the music. So it will help you to forget about all the difficulties at school, to forget about someone who has not been nice to you. So it does help to reduce stress. The second reason is that teenagers who play musical instruments know to manage their time better. Clearly if you want to be good at a musical instrument, you have to spend hours to learn how to play it. So you have to spare an hour or two every day to practice the instrument. In addition to doing the homework and doing the house chores or other duties of the teenagers. So if you want to be good, you have to manage your time real good. The third reason would be to improve concentration. As mentioned before, teenagers or any musical instrument players need to spend time to practice their instrument. So not only time, but also focus. They have to focus on the notes, they have to listen to their playing to correct what's wrong to improve next time. So it will help with their concentration. This will have the ripple effect to other activities in their life where they know how to ignore other distractions to focus on their own business. So in conclusion, I think it is very important and beneficial for teenagers to learn to play a musical instrument. Now let's turn to the follow up questions. I do think that music should be a part of school curriculum because it helps students to reduce stress, to improve concentration and to enrich their soul. But this should not be too hard, too difficult. It should be dependent on the student's interest. In Vietnam, in my country, there are a number of genres of music that are popular now. It can be rap, it can be pop or some genre of music that I can name even. But they are so different, they are so diverse. And I think different kinds of music are suitable for different kinds of audience. Not many old people like listening to rap. Like many young audience would never want to spend time listening to traditional music. So that is why I think it is important for the governments to take some measures to preserve the traditional music in my country. I have the feeling that it has not been preserved, it has not received due attention from the government to protect traditional music. Not to protect but to develop traditional music so that young audience can know what it is, the history of such traditional music and what communities are still preserving such kind of music. So that our next generation knows the roots of our soul, know about our ancestors and I think that is what makes the country preserve their culture.","Alright, so I think there are a few reasons why teenagers might wanna learn to play a musical instrument, like the piano or the guitar. I’d say there are three main reasons, and here they are. 

First off, you know, if you're looking to chill out after a long day of school or studying, playing an instrument can really help. I mean, if you play the guitar or sit down at the piano and listen to the lovely melodies, it’s just kinda magical. You end up feeling one with the music, right? It helps you forget about the tough stuff at school, like maybe some people weren’t nice to you or whatever. So, yeah, it’s a great way to reduce stress.

The second reason is that, you know, if you play an instrument, you kinda learn how to manage your time better. Because let’s face it, if you wanna get good at playing, you have to practice for hours. So you’ve gotta carve out that time, like an hour or two every day, on top of doing your homework and chores and all the stuff you gotta do as a teenager. Managing your time really well becomes super important.

And the third reason would be it helps improve concentration. Like I mentioned before, when you're practicing, it’s not just about the time you spend. You really need to focus, right? You gotta pay attention to the notes and listen to yourself to figure out what you need to fix for next time. This focus really helps in other areas of life, too, because it teaches you how to block out distractions and concentrate on what’s important.

So, in conclusion, I think it’s really valuable for teenagers to learn how to play a musical instrument. Now, moving on to the follow-up questions, I definitely believe music should be a part of the school curriculum. It helps students reduce stress, improve their concentration, and really enrich their lives. But it shouldn’t be too hard or pushy, you know? It should be based on what the students are into.

In Vietnam, where I’m from, there are so many popular music genres today, like rap, pop, and whatever else you can think of. They’re really different and diverse, and I feel like each genre fits a different audience. Like, older folks might not be into rap at all, and a lot of young people might not wanna listen to traditional music. So, it’s super important for the government to take steps to preserve traditional music in my country. I get the sense that it hasn’t really been given the attention it deserves. 

I mean, it's not just about protecting it, but also helping to develop it, so younger audiences can understand what it is, the history behind it, and which communities are still keeping it alive. That way, our next generation knows about our roots and ancestors, and I think it’s really essential for a country to keep its culture alive.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-3.mp3,CD15_3,3

You get to listen to every part of the movie, get to see every action and not get distracted by other people. Secondly I'm not really an outgoing person so going to the cinema and seeing so many people sometimes can be uncomfortable for me. So I prefer to stay at home and enjoy my time watching films. That way I can make snacks or invite my friends over to come and enjoy the film with me or I could make it loud because I live alone and enjoy the sound.

The second advantage when choosing this gift is that when he enjoys reading this book, he can think of me as his best friend and give him this gift, this present. The academic program is difficult to study and it is better for him to read more books and to broaden his knowledge about so many fields. The reason why I didn't choose the other 2 options is that the first one is the photo album.

The second reason is that when he’s reading this book, he can totally think of me, his best friend, who gave it to him. I know his academic program is gonna be tough, so it’s important for him to read more and, like, expand his knowledge across different subjects.

I truly believe it says that you need to prune a child, you need to develop their understanding, and you need to really establish that foundation from the beginning of time so that when they grow up, they will not depart from it. And it is very important that parents know this and understand this, because for me when I was a child, I think I had a very good childhood. I was able to play outside, I was able to meet a lot of friends, so my emotional and social skills are well developed. They were developed and I believe that it has impacted me a lot becoming an adult. Another contributing factor of my mental child development was making sure that I was able to express my ideas, my emotions, my feelings to my parents if I really need to. And I agree that nowadays children should be free to choose what they learn, as long as there is guidance, as long as there is facilitation, as long as there is constant communication between the child and an adult. And I believe this is still one key factor and one of the fundamentals that children need to learn, and it is very essential because I know growing up I had, I don't have problems growing up, I had really great community, I had great parents, I had parents who had helped me become a problem solver, I had parents who challenged me to become a better version of myself. So I have developed my physical health as healthy as it could because I was able to play outside, being curious and just being myself. I was also able to develop a personality, I'm a very extrovert person, that means my social emotional skills, my social skills were really enhanced and were developed when I was a child. So it did not give me any problem when I went into middle school, high school and even college because I wasn't timid. Instead I was able to use my foundations as a child to be able to learn more things, adapt to things, and even just adapting to people's emotions, that I can be more sensitive, I can be more of a good listener, I can be more of a good friend because of what I've learned when I was still a child. So it is really important that we teach our children, me as a teacher, I teach my children to always express themselves, to always express what they really want you to hear because sometimes if children will suppress whatever their emotions are, it's going to have a bad effect in the long run and we don't want that for the next generation. So I totally agree that childhood is the most important time of a person's life and as adults, as parents, as teachers, we need to make sure that we support this idea that we are always there to make these children become better individuals, become better citizens of this world and know how to navigate life because life can be hard, but with our guidance, children, with the next generation, they can be successful in their own little way.","Okay, so I totally agree that childhood is, like, the most important time in a person's life. I really believe that you gotta nurture a child, you know? You have to help them develop their understanding and establish a solid foundation from early on, so when they grow up, they won’t stray too far from it. It's super important for parents to get this, and honestly, I think I had a really good childhood. I was able to play outside, meet lots of friends, and that really helped with my emotional and social skills. I mean, I believe that has had a big impact on me as I grew into adulthood.

Another big part of my childhood development was being able to express my ideas and feelings to my parents when I needed to, you know? And I really agree that these days, kids should have the freedom to choose what they want to learn, as long as there’s some guidance and good communication between them and an adult. I think that’s, like, a key factor in what kids need to learn. 

I mean, when I was growing up, I didn’t have any major problems. I had a great community and supportive parents. They really helped me become a problem solver and challenged me to be a better version of myself. Plus, my physical health was pretty good because I played outside a lot and was just curious and being myself. I developed my personality too, I’m very extroverted, so my social skills really improved when I was younger. 

That meant I didn’t have issues fitting in when I hit middle school, high school, or even college. I wasn’t shy; I could use the foundation I built as a child to learn more, adapt to different situations, and, like, understand people’s emotions better. I could be more sensitive, a good listener, and a good friend because of what I learned during my childhood.

So, it’s really important that we teach our kids. As a teacher, I always encourage my students to express themselves and say what they need to say. Because, you know, if kids start to bottle up their feelings, it could really mess them up in the long run, and we don’t want that for the next generation. So, I completely agree that childhood is, like, the most crucial time in someone’s life. And as adults—whether we’re parents or teachers—we really need to support that idea. We should always be there to help these kids become better individuals and good citizens of the world, so they can learn how to navigate life. Life can be tough, but with our guidance, the next generation can totally find their own success!",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C167/HUST1411220040-3.mp3,CD3,3

Well, I can speak two languages. Foreign language that I would like to learn is Vietnamese. Why? Because I am in Vietnam. I have been for about five years now. So, I would love to speak Vietnamese. Next question. Do you enjoy learning foreign languages? Yes and no. It's always nice and fun to do something new, to learn a new skill. But it can also be very challenging, very difficult to learn a new language, especially with Vietnamese, because it's so tonal and one word can mean many different things. So, it's just the way you pronounce it, like how you, the tone that you speak. Alright, next question. How important is it to learn a foreign language and why? Well, if you're going to stay in a foreign country or a different country, I would say that it is very important to learn that language in the country that you are going to stay in. Just to communicate better, to understand each other better, especially when you are in need, to ask for help or when you buy something, to ask how much or to give direction. So, I would say that if you are planning on staying in a different country where it's not your mother tongue, then I would say it is very important to learn a foreign language, just to have a little bit of communication with the people in that country, just to get by it, day by day. Next, let's talk about your communication with others. What is your favorite way to communicate with others? Well, verbal communication. Having a conversation with people, it's a better interaction and you understand and learn way much more than communicating over a cell phone or a device. Do you prefer sending text messages to talking on the phone? No, sending text messages is time consuming and also it's very hard to read emotion or body language in a text message. So, I would rather have a conversation over the phone with a friend because it makes it easier to understand them.","Hey there! Should I start talking now? I'm not sure what's happening. Okay, so let's dive into foreign languages. What foreign language do I speak and why? Well, I can actually speak two languages. The foreign language I really wanna learn is Vietnamese. And why? Because, you know, I'm in Vietnam and I've been here for about five years now. So, I’d really love to learn Vietnamese.

Next question! Do I enjoy learning foreign languages? It's kinda like a yes and no. I mean, it’s fun and cool to learn something new, like a new skill, right? But at the same time, it can be super challenging, especially with Vietnamese. It's so tonal, and one word can mean a bunch of different things depending on how you pronounce it. It's all about the tone, you know?

Alright, moving on! How important is it to learn a foreign language and why? Well, if you're gonna be in a different country, I'd say it’s super important to learn the language spoken there. It helps a lot with communicating and understanding each other, especially when you need help, or if you’re buying something and wanna ask how much it is, or give directions. So, if you're planning to live in a place where they don’t speak your native language, I’d say it’s really important to learn some of that language just to get by in your day-to-day life.

Next up, let's chat about how I communicate with others. What’s my favorite way to communicate with people? Well, I really like verbal communication, having face-to-face conversations. I feel like it creates better interactions, and you learn and understand so much more than just texting or using a device, you know? 

Now, do I prefer texting or talking on the phone? Honestly, I find texting pretty time-consuming, and it can be tough to read emotions or body language in a text.

I think dictionary had two sides of help me to learn English that is harmful for me to use very much. In that side of the benefits of dictionary help me to solve problem very fast like if I don't know the word in English, Charlotte, what is yeah I think dictionary help me to learn English like help me to find this word very fastly very quickly and I understand the whole meaning of this word by using dictionary so dictionary help also helpful for me like I used a very much dictionary when I working or when I am working or I am studying so it's make me lazy to learn vocabulary every day and makes me delay for vocabulary delay for studying vocabulary or something like that so to be honest I really prefer using dictionaries electronic dictionary","Okay, so I often use a dictionary for work or studying, especially when I’m dealing with English because, you know, I don’t have a huge vocabulary in English yet.

So, I think dictionaries have, like, two sides when it comes to helping me learn English. On one hand, they're super useful, right? Like, if I don't understand a word, I can just look it up quickly. It really helps me to figure out the meaning of words fast, you know? 

But then there's the downside too. I feel like using dictionaries a lot kind of makes me lazy. Like, instead of trying to remember new words every day, I just rely on the dictionary. So, it sort of delays my learning process when it comes to expanding my vocabulary.

To motivate the students to learn English, we can use games, songs, or other activities. Or maybe at the end of the day, we can practice English with everyone. First of all, playing games to learn English is fun. It's easy for everyone to learn. It's very important to learn English. It's very important to learn English. Learning English by playing games is easy to get distracted. Because when someone is playing a game, they will enjoy the game and forget about it. The reason why they are playing games is learning English. In games, we have some sense with bad English. So the learner can learn the bad English too and will not help them to improve their English. Songs are an easy way to learn English. Some of the famous singers in the world are Adele, Catipari, or Soren. The melody is so addictive to hearing. So everyone can learn new words in the song. But some songs have bad words in them. So if you don't understand and try to learn English by playing a song, it's not a good way. Enjoying and enjoying English Club is a good way to learn English. Because you can have a friend in there and you can learn English with a friend. In English Club, sometimes we use the native language. You cannot use English as a native language. So you can use your mother's language and it cannot help. But I think that learning English in some way has good and bad. But if you have learning English, it's very soon as possible to get the chance to have the better English.","Okay, so as English learners, I think we’ve got a lot of fun methods to help us learn English in class.

First off, playing games to learn English is just so much fun! I mean, it’s really easy for everyone to learn that way. Learning English is really important, right? But sometimes when people are playing games, they kinda forget that they're actually learning English. They just get caught up in the game and enjoy it without thinking about the language part. Plus, in games, you might pick up some bad English—you know what I mean? So that’s not really helping them improve.

Now, songs are another easy way to learn English! I mean, there are some really famous singers out there like Adele, Katy Perry, and Soren. Their melodies are so catchy, right? So you can learn new words just by listening to their songs. But then, yeah, some songs might have bad words in them. So, if you’re not careful and you’re just trying to learn English from those songs, it could lead you astray, for sure.

Joining an English Club is also a great way to learn English. You can make friends there and practice together. But, sometimes in English Clubs, folks slip into using their native languages. And when that happens, you aren’t using English as much, which isn’t as helpful.

Like, the first thing I wanna say is, you might need to spend three or four hours just standing around in the shop helping customers and doing all that work, and that's quite a bit when you’re still in college. 

And then, I think being a tutor could be a really good option for you. Like, the first thing is, you could work as an English teacher for kids, and that's pretty great 'cause you get to share your knowledge with them, right? It’s good for you as well 'cause it helps you remember the stuff you learned in high school too. 

Plus, when you're tutoring, you get to control your own schedule. Like, you can choose when you wanna work with the kids. I think being a tutor is actually an easier job for a student, you know, since it doesn’t take up as much time as being a shop assistant would.

audio/HUST281123Q63S167/HUST2811230030-3.ogg," Well, English is one of the most important thing that every person should have. And in Vietnam, learning English is an exceptional subject. And here we are to discuss about how to make English learning fun. Well, as the students who learn English well, in my opinion, the easiest way to make learning English fun is where we will make some games where I learn English. In my high school, there was a game that made me love English so much that up till now, I played it with my friends so I can improve my English better. That is word connecting. The rules start when you start a word. For example, the word games, you will start the word with a G and the next word you start with an S. This game will help children or any others improve their vocabulary and difficulty. This is also a very fun game to play. Next, I would suggest playing a game with songs. Songs are music and it is very easy to connect people with each other. It is one of the most easy ways for people to learn English. In the back time, I have a lot of music and I have great vocabulary. So in my experience, if it was so good at that, why don't we use it? So we can make learning English better and funnier. If I have to suggest for my own idea, I would suggest that I can invite a native teacher and ask them to teach me English. Because native teacher is a very different person from our local teacher. They bring different countries and different methods to study which will make the student curiosity. Sometimes they will share the feeling of studying with the teacher maybe even better than the local teacher. For the question, children should be learning English as soon as it starts school. I think that is as important as knowing a foreign language is very important. The younger they are, the easier they can learn English. For that reason, why don't we let the children learn English as soon as possible? Thank you for your attention.","Okay, so I wanna talk about how important English is, right? I mean, it's one of those things that everyone should really have a good grasp on. And, you know, in Vietnam, learning English is like a really big deal. So, today, we're gonna discuss how to make learning English fun.

Well, in my experience as a student, I think one of the easiest ways to make learning English enjoyable is through games. Back in high school, we had this game that made me fall in love with English, and I still play it with my friends to improve my skills. It’s called word connecting. So, the rules are pretty simple. You start with a word, like ""games,"" and then the next word has to start with the last letter of the previous word, so I would start with a ""G"" and the next person would use an ""S."" This game really helps with vocabulary and it’s super fun to play!

Next, I’d recommend using songs. You know, music is an awesome way to bring people together, and it can make learning English a lot easier. Back then, I listened to a ton of music, and it helped me build a good vocabulary. So, if it worked for me, why not use it for learning? It could definitely make English a lot more engaging and fun.

And if I had to throw in my own idea, I’d say inviting a native teacher to teach English could be really beneficial. Native speakers have different backgrounds and teaching methods that can spark curiosity in students. Sometimes, students connect better with a native teacher than with local teachers, so it could really enhance the learning experience.

Now, regarding when kids should start learning English, I think they should dive in as soon as they start school. Knowing a foreign language is super important, and the younger they are, the easier it can be for them to pick it up. So, I really think we should let kids learn English as early as possible.

As this infographic mentions, it's not only releasing stress or increasing social interaction or has an exercise partner for an elderly person or plays a part as an exercise partner for an elderly person. I think it only it also becomes a friend for life and I think when it comes to the elderly often we experience loneliness and if someone has lost someone already in their lives or has been in a care home for a very long time, loneliness is one of the biggest issues that the elderly encounter. I think when you live alone or it's only you and your partner, having another companion is really helpful to make you feel like your family as a whole and you have another little being to look after and to belong to. And I think by reducing loneliness it is demonstrated that we also ultimately help someone to basically feel happier and it makes life somewhat easier and less lonely and less miserable when you're often on your own. And I think pets can be a playful way to you know chip in with some exercise in your life and that's also something that you can do together with someone so that's also increasing relationships and this sense of belonging. And I think also having to do the chores around the pets increases having a routine for an elderly person so when you have to look after someone you have many many things like feeding, making sure that the pets drink enough water, all of these need to be carried out. And I think this really helps to bring a sense of routines and elderly persons life especially once they may have lost a partner who's helped them with their routine. So that's a very good thing to introduce. And to answer a follow-up question, do you think pets are well raised in your country? I would say yes I think in my country in Hungary pets are raised well there's a lot of guidelines how to raise pets and I think when you take a pet home essentially you're given an info sheet and you're given a veterinary information. Vaccinations are definitely they play a huge part in Hungarian health care for dogs and cats and other pets so I think that's an important part. So yes I would say in Hungary pets are looked after quite well and they're raised quite well. At the same time of course we need to improve the situation in my country as well because we can see that sometimes people get rid of their pets especially after some holidays after Easter because it's a Christian country. Many people get rid of their rabbits which is a very sad thing to happen but I think with the care centres and the shelters on the rise it creates just a better situation for the pets in Hungary and essentially it's a better environment for them to thrive not only for humans but for the animals too and I think there's a lot of control mechanisms introduced in in helping this process by the government but I think mainly the guides and the veterinary information that the new pet parents receive is probably the most helpful thing in Hungary for sure.","I think, you know, raising pets for elderly people is a really good idea. Like, this infographic talks about, it doesn’t just help with stress or getting them to be more social, but it also gives them an exercise partner. I mean, pets can be such great companions, especially for elderly folks who often deal with loneliness. Like, if someone has lost loved ones or has been in a care home for a long time, loneliness is a huge issue, right? If you're living alone or it’s just you and your partner, having a pet to take care of can feel like you have a family again, y'know? It gives you something to bond with and look after. 

And reducing loneliness can really help people feel happier and make life a lot easier and less miserable when they're on their own. Plus, pets can add some fun exercise into the mix, which is something you can share with them too. So, it really helps build relationships and that sense of belonging. 

Also, doing chores for pets creates routines for elderly folks. Like, when you have to feed them and make sure they have enough water, it gives them a lot of little tasks to do, which can really help keep their schedule steady, especially if they've lost a partner who used to help with that stuff. I think that's a really good thing to introduce into their lives.

Now, if you wanna know if pets are well raised in my country, I’d say yes. In Hungary, I think pets are raised pretty well overall. There are lots of guidelines on how to take care of them, and when you get a pet, you usually get an info sheet along with some veterinary info. Vaccinations are a big deal in Hungary for dogs, cats, and other pets, so that plays a huge part in their health care.

But, you know, there’s still room for improvement because sometimes people abandon their pets, especially after the holidays, like after Easter. It’s pretty sad, especially since it's a Christian country and a lot of people get bunnies but then just get rid of them. Thankfully, though, with more care centers and shelters popping up, it’s getting better for pets in Hungary. It creates a nicer environment for both animals and humans to thrive. The government’s also putting in some controls to help in the process, but I think the guides and veterinary info that new pet owners get is probably the most helpful thing in Hungary, for sure.",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD2/audio/HUST241022SCRI167/HUST2410220048-3.mp3,CD2,3
audio/HUST281123Q63S167/HUST2811230046-3.ogg," So on the topic of teenagers should be encouraged to live more apparently. I don't think that's quite the case yet. I mean, are we talking about 18 from the university or like high school? I mean, I believe it's university. Of course, living independently in the university would have them be less important on their families, firstly. Less important on their families and others as well since... So let's put it on the others. That's the case when since you just moved out from the family, your parents wouldn't have to prepare you a room, feed you and other stuff. They can have more time for themselves just the two people alone on themselves. So since you are living independently, you will be more responsible for yourself at least. So you have to clean, cook for yourself, manage your own time. There will be nobody to put you up in the morning for work or class or whatever. So that's responsible. You also have to pay your own bills on time as well, manage your financial, so you have to get jobs, manage your savings, manage your time between classes and works. Since you are a teenager, you will most likely be working part time. If you are going to the professional school, then you should have to go to school as well as work. And since you are not working, you have money now, you will be more confident. You will be spending your own money, you won't have to ask anybody for the money. And if you are responsible with your own financial choices, you will live quite nice. You can buy what you want, the reasonable price as well. So for the three questions about how I have parents, the white parents teach the children change in the past 10 years, I would say a lot. How my parents raised me was a very strict, they just sent me to class and that's about it. They sent me to class, fed me, make sure that I behave, I guess that's about it. How my peers, the people who are my age, the reason the children is that they are encouraging self independence, they are encouraging students to learn to think for themselves to be responsible from a very young age. The teenagers in my country have more opportunity to live. And apparently, I doubt it. I mean, cultural issue aside, it's also a huge economic issue. Things are very expensive and for a teenager that works part time, you will barely be able to cover your costs of living, let alone spending stuff. So living with your parents might be a better choice. Roles of parents in helping the children in my country is just to encourage them to give them support when they can.","So, okay, when we're talking about whether teenagers should be encouraged to live more independently, I don’t really think that’s always the case, you know? Like, are we talking about, you know, 18-year-olds going off to university, or are we including high schoolers too? I mean, I really believe it's more about university students. Living independently at that age can make them less reliant on their families, for sure. 

First off, if you move out of your family house, your parents don’t have to, like, set up your room, feed you, and all that stuff. They get more time for themselves, just the two of them, right? And when you’re living on your own, you’ve gotta take care of yourself. You’ve got to clean your place, cook your own meals, and manage your own time. Nobody’s gonna wake you up for work or classes, so that’s a big responsibility. You also have to pay your bills on time and manage your finances. This means getting a job, saving money, and balancing your time between school and work. 

Since you’re a teenager, you're probably working part-time, and if you’re in a vocational school, you’ve gotta juggle both work and classes. Once you start earning your own money, it really boosts your confidence, 'cause you’re not asking anyone for cash. If you handle your finances well, you can live pretty nicely, you know? You can buy the stuff you want, as long as it's reasonably priced. 

Now, about the three questions on how parenting has changed in the last decade, I've gotta say, a lot has changed. My parents were pretty strict with me—they basically just sent me to classes and made sure I behaved. That's about it! But nowadays, parents seem to encourage more self-independence in kids. They want their children to think for themselves and be responsible from a younger age. 

But, honestly, I’m not so sure that teenagers today have more opportunities to live independently, especially considering cultural and economic factors. Things are just really expensive.

We have Google as a worldwide friends to all the people and we can like to do very much everything on the internet right now. The Google is fast enough for us to research for the basic information that we have. But the more user friendly is giving the person what they want right away and not giving more of a side questions and more of a matters unfortunate information. But information bodies have their informative side so you have to be filtered out pretty much and giving your own research and a mildly dive and dive in every information, every sources that you have because some source on Google is not that reliable. For most part I think Google is a very quick tool to use but a quick tool to use for information searching and it's a very it has various all kinds of information that you want to have. Some things that information is not reliable on the internet but I think that information is what make people have their powers information on Google is exactly the same. Google has become one of the most one of the biggest companies in the world and in the Silicon Valley if you know. The reliable on the internet depends on what you filter out when you are searching.

Agrees on every information is not what you would do so be just keep in mind for a second opinion when you want to have a more reliable and trust your gut when you want to research for something more important and serious for your question. To avoid like internet in general addictions I think you should give yourself a thumbs up whenever you searching for things on the internet because internet is more of a intro because society is more of the interacting so interact with people too.","Okay, so I wanna talk about Google and how it's like, you know, one of the most popular search engines we have right now, especially in this 4.0 generation of technology. I mean, Google feels like a worldwide friend to everybody, right? We can basically do just about everything online these days. 

Google's super fast when it comes to finding basic information. But, you know, what's really user-friendly is that it gets you what you want right away, without throwing too much extra stuff at you or irrelevant questions. But you gotta remember that not all information is created equal. You really have to filter things out and do some research on your own.

Overall, I think Google’s a quick and handy tool for searching information, and it has, like, a ton of topics you can explore. But, yeah, some info online isn’t trustworthy.

Like, if I search for something, say, I have a migraine today, Google will throw a bunch of info at me, but sometimes it can be a bit over-the-top and not give me the most accurate diagnosis. That’s why it’s crucial to consult with professionals instead of just relying on what you find online.

Oh, and to avoid getting too caught up online, I'd say give yourself a little thumbs up when you're searching.

audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220060-3.ogg," I'm going to talk about how Facebook is a useful tool for students. As we may know, Facebook is a very popular social networking site. To the young people, they can provide great help. The first benefit of Facebook is that it can provide a rich source of information. By following the pages on Facebook, the students can get information pop up on their news feed every day. Those pieces of information are delivered in bite signs, which means that it's not too long. So the students may find it easier to take in the information, in contrast to the long lectures that they find on the videos on other platforms. It can also provide a different way of learning. People on Facebook can create different kinds of groups. In those groups, they can share information with each other, they can share tips for studying, or they can share different resources. It can also be a means of entertainment. After a long period of time spent for studying, the students can go on Facebook and watch funny videos, or they can talk with their friends, or they can comment on their friends' photos. I think that Facebook is a tool that can be very effective for students. Talking about some of the follow up questions here. What are the negative influences of Facebook? One thing that people usually talk about is that social media, especially Facebook, can cause addiction. People tend to scroll continuously without noticing the time. That would be very time consuming and it would take a lot of time away from productive activities. Another problem that Facebook may have is that it provides videos and posts that require shorter attention from the users. The users will tend to read the short posts and videos. They may find it harder to concentrate if they have to engage with a more difficult task that requires a longer period of time. The second question is that definitely the number of Facebook users has changed over the last 10 years in my country. As I remember, 10 years ago, people tended to use another platform like Yahoo. Within these 5 years, the number of Facebook users has increased significantly.","Okay, so I’m gonna talk about how Facebook is really a useful tool for students. You know, Facebook is super popular, especially among young people, and it can definitely be a big help for them. 

So, the first big benefit of Facebook is that it offers a ton of information. When students follow different pages, they get quick updates popping up on their news feeds every day. And these bits of info are usually pretty short, which makes it easier for students to take it in, unlike long lectures or videos on other platforms that can be kinda overwhelming. 

Also, Facebook gives students a different way to learn. There are tons of groups they can join where they can share information, study tips, and resources with each other. Plus, it can be entertaining too! After studying for a while, students can hop on Facebook, watch funny videos, chat with friends, or comment on their pals' photos, you know? 

I really think Facebook can be super effective for students. Now, about the follow-up questions. So, what are some negative influences of Facebook? Well, a big thing people often mention is addiction. Like, people can easily get caught up scrolling for a long time without even realizing how much time has passed. That can really take away from doing more productive stuff. 

And another issue is that Facebook encourages shorter attention spans. Users tend to gravitate toward the quick posts and videos, which might make it harder for them to focus on tasks that require more time and concentration. 

As for the second question, there's definitely been a shift in how many people use Facebook over the past 10 years in my country.

I mean, if my cousin's going far away, they likely won't get a lot of help from our family, you know? So, they'll need to keep their expenses down, and dorms are pretty cheap. With a reasonable price for the dorm, they can also save up for other things they might need later on. 

Plus, dorms usually come with security, which is super important. If they’re planning to live alone, away from family for the first time, security is something that’s definitely gonna be on their family's mind. They wanna make sure they're safe, right? And living in a dorm also gives you nice services like dining and laundry, so you don’t have to worry about those chores yourself. That can really help someone who's far from home to focus more on their studies.

Now, as for the other options, I wouldn’t pick a shared apartment 'cause that can get kinda pricey, and you never really know who you’ll be living with.

I sent the podcast to my friend who is in another country and we had to talk to the mail to talk to the postcard and I was drawing him a lot of birthday presents and stuff on the postcard. The benefits of sending a podcast is you can put a lot of things in the podcast.

I really enjoy evening walks at the park 'cause it’s nice and cool, and there are lots of streets where you can just soak in the environment when it’s dark. I mean, you can hear people joking around or chatting loudly, which is kinda fun. 

There are definitely some benefits to an evening walk. For me, when I’m walking, I feel way more relaxed, and it’s a good form of exercise, you know? It's perfect for when you don’t have much time to hit the gym or do other sports.

In the modern times, we have more and more relationships, including our families, our friends, and our spouses as well. However, besides the loss of benefits that these relationships may offer, sometimes we can feel unsatisfied with our relationships. For example, we can feel stressed with our friends if they cannot agree with some of our opinions. There are some reasons why we are stressed with our friends. Sometimes we have to cope with financial situations, especially when we are employees and have to work in order to earn for a living. Financial pressures happen when we have to raise a family. For example, when we have to raise up a kid and we have to go for work in order to earn money for raising up the kid, our kid. It is important to make sure that we have to both guarantee our kids living and at the meantime, guaranteeing jobs at work. Thirdly, heavy workload is also considered as a major reason causing stress. It is more and more common that employees have to stay at the office after 8pm or even later to finish their jobs. However, they cannot earn the satisfied salary. This is one of the reasons that may cause stress between the employees. Also, in order to maintain the promotion, the employees must make sure that sometimes they have to work overtime and they cannot control their schedule or living habits. This may cause some health problems. In order to reduce stress, we should make sure that we have to stay a very healthy and balanced living style. We should stay away from some unhealthy relationships and we should also maintain a good mental and physical health.","Okay, so, you know, stress is becoming more and more common in our daily lives these days. I mean, in modern times, we have a lot of relationships to juggle, like with our families, friends, and partners. But, even though these relationships can bring benefits, sometimes we just feel unsatisfied. For instance, we might feel stressed out with our friends if they don’t agree with us on certain things.

There are some reasons why we feel stressed with our friends. Like, one big reason is financial pressure. I mean, when you're working to earn a living, especially if you have a family to support, it can get really tough. Like, when you have kids to raise, you need to work to make sure they have what they need, right? So, it’s super important to balance both providing for your kids and keeping your job.

And then, there's also this heavy workload that kind of adds to the stress. It’s pretty common now for employees to be at the office late, sometimes after 8 PM, just to finish their tasks. And the thing is, they often don't get paid enough for all those extra hours. This can really lead to stress among workers. Plus, if you want to get promotions, sometimes you have to work overtime, and that can really mess with your schedule and your living habits. That can even lead to health issues down the line.

The first one is the decline in death rate. Thanks to the development in healthcare system and the technology, people, especially the elderly are now provided with more sufficient healthcare treatment. So the death rate is decreasing significantly over the past decades. The second reason is due to the lack of family planning. So in many countries, especially in developing countries where people, especially the underprivileged people are not informed about the family planning and they don't have adequate measures to have children. So many children experience the problem in their family members. Another reason for the overpopulation is because of the development of the society. Well, thanks to the improving living standards in many countries nowadays, people are now encouraged to give birth to a child. For example, in many developed countries like Japan, the nation experienced a broad gap between the elderly and the young and the lack of working adults. So thanks to the higher living standards and the problems in the population gap, the governments are now encouraging people to give birth more. So in some parts of the world, due to the lack of family planning, the country is overpopulated. But in other parts of the world, the country is experiencing the problems in the population gap. So people are also encouraged to increase the population. So that is the major causes of overpopulation across the globe. What are the negative effects of overpopulation? Obviously, the overpopulation creates the burden for many governments over the world to ensure the healthcare system, the education and even the food for all of their people. What can be done to solve the problem of overpopulation? So better family planning.","Okay, so nowadays, the number of people around the world is just, you know, going up, and this overpopulation has a few causes. The first one is the decline in the death rate. Thanks to, like, improvements in healthcare and technology, people—especially the elderly—are getting way better medical treatment, so the death rate has really gone down a lot over the past few decades. 

The second reason is about family planning, right? In a lot of countries, especially developing ones, many people, particularly the underprivileged, just aren’t informed about family planning and don’t have the right resources to manage having kids. So, a lot of children end up facing issues because of that.

Another reason for overpopulation is societal development. So, like, with living standards improving in many countries, people are being encouraged to have children, you know? For instance, in places like Japan, there's this big gap between the elderly and the younger population, plus there aren’t enough working adults. So, because of the higher living standards and this population gap issue, many governments are pushing for people to have more kids.

So, you see, in some parts of the world, the lack of family planning is leading to overpopulation, while in other areas, they're facing issues with having enough young people. It’s kind of a mixed bag when it comes to population challenges. 

Now, about the negative effects of overpopulation—well, obviously, it's putting a strain on governments to provide healthcare, education, and even food for everyone.

Um, I really think trees are super important for us. First off, having a lot of trees helps with the chemical emissions, like CO2, which makes our environment better, you know? And with all kinds of long-lived trees, we can have a healthier environment and better food sources too.

If you think about it, when you're under a street lined with trees, the temperature is usually cooler compared to areas without many trees. So, trees really help make the weather a bit healthier. But I’ve noticed in my country, we don’t have as many long-lived trees, so we definitely need to plant more.

Also, I think the education about trees in schools isn’t really popular these days. People don’t seem to realize how important trees are. A lot of them are being cut down for wood or to create more space in cities, which is sad. I believe schools should focus more on teaching how to protect and plant more trees.

Actually, in some schools in Hanoi and in some provinces, there are activities that encourage students to plant trees, like letting them grow small trees in the schoolyard. I think that’s a really good start! 

Apart from providing a healthier environment, trees also give us a great source of food. They produce fruits and even flowers, which can be used in cooking. Speaking of attitudes towards trees, I think different generations view them differently. Older generations seem to have a more positive and protective attitude, as they’re usually more into planting and know how to take care of trees.

But it feels like younger generations aren’t learning enough about preserving trees. So, the first thing we really need to do is encourage education for young people. That way, when the older generations can’t care for the environment anymore, the younger ones can take over and keep it healthy.

I mean, I wanna give her a book because she's like a total book addict and reads a ton of stuff, especially those books that I’ve recommended to her before. So, I was thinking, you know, a book could be like a really meaningful gift for her. 

'Cause, you know, when you’re not young anymore, like when you hit over 30, some gifts just don’t feel as exciting as they used to when we were kids, right? So I wanna get her something that, like, gives her a little life advice or information that can really help her out. 

I’m thinking of getting her a book about how the universe works or something like that, because, you know, understanding the universe is super important in our lives. Like, if you do good things, good things come back, but if you mess up, you might run into problems later on. 

So the book I have in mind for her is called “Past Life.” I think it’s really important and it’s pretty famous too, and I know she’s really into it. The thing is, she hasn’t bought it yet, so I thought I could get it for her birthday.

And to various extent I fully agree with this statement because with printed books, it helps us to absorb the information and memorize it better and quicker, also easier. It also helps us to improve our attention, improve our concentration when reading. It's a book ahead made from paper in front of you and you just simply cannot just ignore it. Also, researchers already have worked on that and have at the end confirmed that if you read a real printed book, a real book made from front of you, your brain also gets the information quicker, better and memorizes it better in a way. And also for myself personally, I love reading. And for me, printed books are always the first and the most favorite options because I really feel reading when I have a printed book in front of me lying lazily on a sofa in the garden under the sun, having music in the background and then in front of you just a printed book and you just go one by one, go page by page and then with your finger pointing out into different words and just enjoy and then just imagine whatever is contained in these words. And your imagination is just fully activated. So I love printed books. But then, you know, nowadays there's also another sort of book that is becoming more and more and more popular, which is e-book. And e-book has a certain advantage towards printed books. It's easy to bring along. It's not thick at all. It's just with a small kinder, you just have hundreds of books in size. So in terms of bringing along and then going around with books in a blanket, then it's much easier for you to have e-book. So that is a theory of better accessibility to whatever book you want, how many books you want. And it does really exist in parallel to printed books. Some really like e-book more than printed books, but I do not think that one day one will replace totally the others. It will just each has its own advantage and disadvantage. Each has its own fan and community and target groups. And people love e-book, also love printed book. And the other way around. So I think it will just last together with the time. It will not replace the others' e-book. So it will just last in parallel. I think more and more people should read books and whatever form of books they feel comfortable with, they should go with it. Traveling, for example, e-book is very convenient. But when you are at home sitting in a library, printed book is the best thing you can get and you can enjoy. So I do support both formats of books.","Okay, so, you know, people always say that printed books should be used in classrooms instead of e-books, and like, I really kinda agree with that. I mean, printed books help us absorb information better and memorize it quicker and just easier, you know? They also help improve our attention and concentration when we're reading. I mean, you’ve got a book made of paper right in front of you, and it’s just hard to ignore that. Plus, researchers have shown that, like, when you read a real printed book, your brain picks up the information quicker and memorizes it better, which is great.

Personally, I really love reading, and for me, printed books are always my first choice. There's just something about lying on a sofa in the garden under the sun with some music playing in the background, having a printed book in hand. You're just flipping through the pages, pointing at words, and really getting lost in the story. It's like your imagination is fully activated, and I just love that vibe.

But, you know, these days, e-books are getting super popular too. They definitely have their perks. I mean, you can carry hundreds of e-books around without the weight of all that paper, right? It makes them way easier to bring along when you’re on the go. So, there's this whole idea of better accessibility with e-books since you can have so many at your fingertips.

I don’t think one will replace the other; they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Like, some people really love e-books, but others are all about printed books, and that’s perfectly fine. They both have their fans and communities. It’s just gonna be that way; they can coexist, you know? 

I think more and more people should read, no matter what format they prefer. Like, when you're traveling, e-books are super convenient. But if you're at home just chilling in a library, there’s nothing like a printed book, right? So, yeah, I totally support both formats of books.",8.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD2/audio/HUST241022SCRI166/HUST2410220017-3.mp3,CD2,3
audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230245-3.ogg," I do believe that husband and wife should assume the same wrong in the family. This is especially favourable in an era where there is a pronoun shift regarding the dynamics of employment and the era of gender equality. It can be said that there are more men are allowed to conduct their projects at home. Meanwhile, the position like silk or t-shirt demanding an abandoned female worker. This means that more men are now able to stay at home, taking care of their offspring. Meanwhile, their partner can contribute to generating monetary value. Furthermore, thanks to the feminism movement, there are less social commentary on men doing household chores. This means that now males can be comfortable with taking the parents' responsibility without the concerns of negative commentary against them. Additionally, it should also be taken into consideration that when husband and wife have equal wrong in the family, there are less quarrels resulting from conflict when the wife was the only in the video doing the household chores and the men are the only breadwinner. In fact, in Japan, when husband and wife have the same wrong in the family, there has been a significant decline of 50% in the number of conflicts. How does conflict recorded in this country in the latest 5 years?","Okay, so I think that husbands and wives should share the same responsibilities in the family. This is really important, you know, especially in this time where we’re seeing changes in employment dynamics and gender equality. I mean, there are more men who are able to work from home now, which is great. At the same time, jobs like silk-making or t-shirt production used to mostly rely on women, but that’s changing. So now, more men are at home taking care of the kids while their partners can go out and earn money.

And, you know, thanks to the feminist movement, there’s way less judgment on guys doing household chores now. This means men can take on parenting roles without worrying about what others might think. Plus, when both partners share equal responsibilities, it leads to fewer arguments about, like, household chores. It’s pretty common to see conflicts arise when one partner feels they’re doing all the work. 

Actually, in Japan, there’s been a big drop—like 50%—in family conflicts when both the husband and wife share the load equally. That's a pretty significant number. I wonder how those conflicts have changed over the past five years in that country?",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_3/audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230245-3.mp3,CD13_3,3

I mean, it’s such a historical and cultural spot in our city. Once you’re here, you really get a sense of the history and culture, you know? It’s named after a well-known folk story about this guy, Le Loi, who, it’s said, received a magical sword from a turtle. He used that sword to defeat his enemies, and then he returned it to the turtle right there at Hoan Kiem Lake. That's why it’s called Hoan Kiem, which means ""Return Sword.""

Another great thing about this place is that there are so many delicious Hanoi specialties you can try around the lake. Plus, you’ve got other tourist spots nearby like Đai Nghìn and Thapu, and even the Opera House. Those are some of the most popular attractions right around Hoan Kiem Lake.

When you visit, you can really dive into a bunch of cool activities both during the day and at night. On weekends, they actually close off the street next to the lake for a walking street, and there’s a ton of stuff to do there. Sometimes, they even have concerts for special occasions, like New Year or other Vietnamese holidays.

Among these 3 options, I believe that Hanoi could be the best choice because of the foreign reasons. The first is the weather. My friend came to Vietnam this August so it is the time of the Autumn. So, we all know that Hanoi is very beautiful in the Autumn time. The weather is not very hot, it's not very cold. So, I think it's not very much so. Spent the August time in Hanoi is the best choice I think. The second reason is about the food in Hanoi. Here Hanoi is the capital city of Vietnam so there's a lot of interesting and delicious dishes in Hanoi. You can try Yum Cha and Gom. Gom in the Autumn is a specialty of Hanoi. We all know that. There's much more delicious food. And the third reason is about the people of Hanoi. The people in Hanoi are very soft and friendly and I believe that my friends will love people here in Hanoi. The reason why I do not choose Hue or Ho Chi Minh City is that I believe that visiting Hue in August is not a good choice. Because there's a time where we had a lot of rain. It's raining all day from the morning to midnight so we cannot do anything together. We cannot go out to visit the famous place in Hue. Ho Chi Minh sounds to be good but I will not choose Ho Chi Minh City because Ho Chi Minh City is a little bit far and the city is too crowded. It's quite hot in Ho Chi Minh City during August so I think to have three days wonderful in Vietnam I think Hanoi is the best option of these trees. I will suggest Hanoi for my friends and I to have time together. Thank you. So, we will read it and then we will read it.","So, okay, my friend is gonna visit Vietnam this August for like three days, and I’ve got three options for him: Hanoi, Hoi An, and Ho Chi Minh City. Among these three, I really think Hanoi is the best choice for a few reasons. 

First off, the weather is pretty great. Since my friend’s coming in August, that’s actually when autumn starts in Vietnam. We all know Hanoi looks beautiful in the fall. The weather’s not too hot and it’s not too cold either, you know? So, spending August in Hanoi is definitely a good idea, I think.

Then there’s the food. Hanoi is the capital, right? So it’s got tons of interesting and delicious dishes to try. You’ve got things like Yum Cha and Gom. You know, Gom is a specialty in the autumn, and it’s really tasty. There’s just so much good food to enjoy!

And, you know, the people in Hanoi are super friendly and welcoming. I really believe my friend will love hanging out with the locals here.

Now, I didn't pick Hue or Ho Chi Minh City for a couple of reasons. For Hue, visiting in August isn’t ideal because, honestly, it can rain a lot during that time. Sometimes it’s like non-stop rain from morning till midnight, and that really puts a damper on exploring the famous sites.

As for Ho Chi Minh City, it sounds great, but it’s a bit far from where we’ll be, and honestly, it’s really crowded. Plus, it gets pretty hot there in August. So, yeah, I think for those three days in Vietnam, Hanoi is really the best option. I’m definitely gonna suggest Hanoi to my friend so we can have an awesome time together! Thank you!

For example, spam, personal information hacking, computer viruses and some bad person, some bad people will take your money from bank through the internet. I think now our home is no longer a safe place because right now it's internet worldwide so in your smartphone it will have your location and the thieves will hack into your phones or your laptop and they will know your address and they know your place so they will go to your place to steal something in your house and the government should do something to have people such as they have to improve the police security on online environment to determine the hackers and the thieves on the online platform and so they will capture them and get to the prison. I think we should stay away from the online as much as possible such as we will not public all of our information on the online and the bad people will not know it and they will not use that information to affect you. I think we will prevent the problems by ourselves. For example, for the problem of computer viruses we can install some software to prevent these viruses and for the personal information hacking problem we don't upload our sensitive information on the internet and we will have to set our password very strongly and when you have any problem with your personal privacy you should contact the government to address them.","Yeah, I totally agree that personal privacy is kinda under threat from the internet, you know?

It’s crazy!

I think our homes don’t feel like safe spaces anymore. With the internet being so worldwide, your smartphone can share your location, and that’s just a bit scary. Thieves can hack into our phones or laptops and figure out our addresses, and then they might break in and steal something from us. So, I think the government really needs to step up. They should work on improving online security, like having more police presence in those online environments to catch hackers and thieves so they can be punished, you know?

Also, we should be super careful online and not share all our personal info. If we keep that stuff private, then those bad people won’t have anything to use against us. I believe we can kinda prevent a lot of these problems ourselves. For example, to tackle computer viruses, we can just install some good software to keep them out. And for protecting our personal information, we should avoid posting sensitive data online and use really strong passwords. If we do run into any issues with privacy, then yeah, definitely reach out to the government to help sort it out.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_3/audio/HUST111223NEPL167/HUST1112230240-3.mp3,CD14_3,3
audio/HUST44237SIU167/HUST0404230281-3.ogg," Well, honestly, I do believe that a good worker can perform well in any working environment if they are creative, honesty, responsibility, and independent. Firstly, a good worker or potential worker should have creativity. Firstly, creativity can help them to manage their work well and they can develop their work in the future. Besides that, those who have creativity can be positive when they get stuck at work. So they will find out the best way to work out of that workload or the stress. They can get put into the balance when they get stuck at work. Besides that, honesty is one of the important parts that can make a good worker. So if a worker is honest, they can build trust, they can gain the trust, or their boss can build trust on them. So if they are honest, that worker can work well with another college or even with the boss. And besides that, responsibility is also very important. Firstly, if they have a responsibility with their work, their work can be done faster and they can gain the achievement from that kind of work. And the responsibility can help that worker to be the best one because if they have a responsibility, so they can meet the deadline and they can control their work and commit their working. And lastly, in terms of independence point, I think that the good worker should be an independent person. Those who can work well under pressure or work alone. Because if they can work alone, they can learn more, search for any courses for more information to strengthen themselves. And some other quality that a worker should have in a modern world, that is they have to gain the well-informed, they can learn that from many courses. I think it's important for modern workers to learn new skills. Yes, I totally believe that. The modern worker should learn new skills. It's not only learn from their work, but also they have to take up skills from their college, like how to manage time or how to learn more skills, like soft skills that are really good for those who work in marketing. And how has the definition of a good worker changed in the last 10 years? That has changed much from the last 10 years. So before that, the workers only focused on the qualification, but now they focus on soft skills.","Okay, so honestly, I really think that a good worker can thrive in any kind of work environment if they're creative, honest, responsible, and independent. So, first off, I believe creativity is super important. I mean, creativity helps them manage their tasks better and it sets them up for development in their roles in the future. Plus, when they hit those tough spots at work, being creative allows them to stay positive and find the best way to tackle the stress or workload. You know, it helps them keep things balanced when they feel stuck.

Then there's honesty, which is definitely one of those key qualities for a good worker. If someone is honest, they build trust not just with their colleagues but also with their boss. This trust is essential for good teamwork and smooth collaboration. 

And, of course, responsibility is a big deal too. When workers take responsibility for their tasks, they can get things done faster and achieve more from their efforts. Having that sense of responsibility means they meet deadlines and are able to stay on top of their commitments. 

Lastly, independence plays a crucial role too. I think a good worker should be someone who can work well under pressure or even on their own. If they can handle things solo, they're able to learn more and seek out resources to improve themselves. 

Now, talking about skills in today's modern world, I really believe that workers need to be well-informed and keep learning through various courses. It's super important for them to learn new skills. It’s not just about what they pick up at work; they should also develop skills from college—like time management and soft skills, which are really valuable, especially for those in marketing and similar fields.

So, how has the definition of a good worker changed in the last ten years? Well, it’s changed quite a bit. You know, back then, the focus was mostly on qualifications, but now it’s shifted toward soft skills. It’s really interesting to see how the workplace expectations have evolved!",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_3/audio/HUST44237SIU167/HUST0404230281-3.mp3,CD8_3,3

I think my specialty is very challenging, especially, first of all, it's not just about the knowledge, it's also about the hand technique, the hand skills, which is very hard for us to practice it, unlike sports or net activities. There are many ways to practice it, but the only way we have to practice it is on the patients, so we don't have many chances, and each chance is very precious, and it can harm the patient's life, so it's very precious. In the future, after graduation, I hope to be a very good surgeon, and I hope in the future, the medical schools in Vietnam can have more corps, I mean the corps, the dead people, for doctors to train on them before doing on their patients. At the moment, I have a lot of free time at the weekends, and I usually have free time every evening and weekends. I usually spend time reading books or cooking some meals for my family. Personally, I think cooking meals and sharing time together with our family or friends and see them enjoy our food, which we prepared in a happy way. I think it's very relaxing and it's a memorable moment for me. In my free time, I prefer spending my free time alone to reading books or sometimes with just my family. Rarely, maybe one time a month, I spend my free time with my friends, but mostly I'm an introverted person. I enjoy being alone, and yeah, that's it.","So, right now, I'm a medical student, and my major is, like, learning to be a surgeon, you know, specialized in orthopedics. I think my specialty is really challenging 'cause it’s not just about the knowledge. It's also about having those hand skills, which can be super tough to practice. It’s not like sports or, you know, any other activities. There are lots of ways to practice, but honestly, the only way we really can is on patients. So, we don’t get many chances, and every chance is, like, really precious. It can totally affect a patient's life, so yeah, it’s a big deal.

In the future, after I graduate, I hope to become a really good surgeon. I also wish that in the future, the medical schools in Vietnam could have more corpses, like, real bodies for doctors to train on before they actually work on patients. 

At the moment, I have a lot of free time on the weekends, and I usually have some free time every evening too. I like to spend my time reading books or cooking meals for my family. Personally, I think cooking and sharing time with family or friends and seeing them enjoy the food I made, it’s just a happy thing. I find it really relaxing, and it creates some memorable moments for me. 

When it comes to my free time, I tend to prefer being alone, like, reading books or just hanging out with my family. I rarely go out with friends, maybe just once a month, but mostly, yeah, I’m kind of an introverted person.

But you know, I'm having some soft meals like a noodle or some rice with egg or something. Though my favorite cooking show is the Matachapas, I buy it quite interesting. Now I'm going to talk about summer holidays. My summer holidays usually last for about a week. I choose to travel with my family in Nhậnh. We should go to the beach or to the mountains to see the scenery. In my opinion, summer is not the best season in Vietnam because it's so hot out there. So it's good weather. We're so clean. But everything is not going to go well in my opinion. My favorite food would be meatball. In addition to my cooking, I usually have my friends cook for me. So it's time to do the dishes.","Okay, so I don't really cook for myself that often, you know, 'cause I live alone. Cooking feels like a lot of work to me. For lunch, I usually just go out to eat.

Now, talking about summer holidays, they usually last about a week for me. I like to travel with my family to places like Nhậnh. We usually go to the beach or the mountains to take in the scenery. Honestly, I don't think summer is the best season in Vietnam 'cause it gets super hot, you know? The weather can be nice and all, but I just feel like not everything goes smoothly during that time.

I've studied English since like 6 years old. Yeah, and I've been using it for quite a while. And as for Chinese, I have only started to learn Chinese recently. Because as I entered university, I found that Chinese actually creates a lot of job opportunities. Yeah, and so I decided to learn Chinese alongside with English to increase my chances of getting a well-paid job. As for enjoying learning a foreign language, I absolutely do. I think it is very interesting to learn another language because it also means you can approach another culture with different ways of thinking, different ways of processing stuff. So yeah, I really do love learning languages, if only I have the time. I think it is really important to know at least one foreign language because we're living in the age of globalization and communication is stronger than ever. Therefore, learning a foreign language, specifically English, would help you connect with more people. There's more opportunity. In fact, if you don't have any knowledge about another language, then it would be very difficult to have access to information as well as job opportunities. Okay, so for communications with others, my favorite way to communicate with other people are face-to-face conversations and texting. As for face-to-face, I think it's pretty obvious that this kind of communication is very direct. We can have very direct conversation, we can share thoughts without having any miscommunication. I mean, there could be miscommunications, but it would be limited because we're facing face-to-face. Where any miscommunication happens, we would be able to identify them. I prefer to send text messages because like many young people, I don't have that much time for calling and also it costs way more. So yeah, I prefer texting. And face-to-face communication, as I mentioned, is very beneficial.","Okay, so I wanna talk about the foreign languages I speak, which are English and Chinese. So, starting with English, it's actually my first foreign language. I’ve been studying English since I was like six years old, yeah. I’ve been using it for quite a while now. And then, there's Chinese. I just recently started learning it, you know, when I got to university. I found out that knowing Chinese opens up a lot of job opportunities, so I thought, why not? I decided to learn Chinese along with English to boost my chances of landing a well-paid job.

Now, when it comes to enjoying learning a foreign language, I totally do! I think it’s super interesting to learn another language because it also helps you understand another culture and think in different ways. So, yeah, I really love learning languages, if only I had more time, you know? I think it’s really important to know at least one foreign language, especially since we’re living in this globalized world where communication is stronger than ever. Learning a foreign language, like English, really helps you connect with more people and creates more opportunities. Honestly, if you don’t know another language, accessing information and job opportunities can be really tough.

Okay, so as for communicating with others, my favorite ways are face-to-face conversations and texting. Face-to-face communication is, like, pretty straightforward. It’s direct, and we can share our thoughts without a lot of miscommunication. I mean, sure, there could still be some misunderstandings, but they’re usually limited when you’re talking in person. If something goes wrong, we can figure it out right there.

I choose these options because of these following reasons. First, there's a theater near my house so it is very convenient for me and my friends to go and book some tickets for a movie. Another reason is that the price here is very reasonable so we can bring more friends to watch with us. I don't choose the second option which is going shopping because we are boys so we find no interest in going to a shopping to a shop almost and buying stuffs. The final option which is singing karaoke is also not suitable because the price here is very high and we have to bring a lot of money and therefore I cannot invite all my friends. So to sum up the first option which is seeing a movie is the most suitable way for me and my friends to go when we spend a Sunday evening out. Well, there's still 40 seconds left.","Okay, so my friends and I are thinking about what to do on a Sunday evening, and we've got three options. Honestly, I really think the first one, which is seeing a movie, is the best choice. So, I have a couple of reasons for that. First off, there's a theater really close to my house, which makes it super convenient for us to just get there and grab some tickets. 

Another reason is that the prices are pretty reasonable, so we could even invite more friends to join us. Now, I’m not really feeling the second option, which is going shopping, 'cause, you know, we're guys and we don’t really enjoy shopping for stuff that much. And then there's the third option, karaoke, but that's also not great ‘cause it can be pretty expensive, and I wouldn’t be able to invite everyone if we had to spend a lot on that.

So, yeah, to wrap it up, I think the best option for me and my friends is definitely seeing a movie for our Sunday night out. Well, I still have like 40 seconds left, but that kinda covers it!",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_1/audio/HUST281123Q63S177/HUST2811230069-2.mp3,CD17_1,2

I mean, honestly, I think there's no place in Vietnam quite like Hanoi when it comes to the vibe and peace it offers. We have this really cool old quarter with a lot of famous spots, like Hoan Kiem Lake and West Lake, plus so many other beautiful places. And let's not forget about the food! Hanoi has some of the best specialty dishes. I think she's really gonna love trying Pho, for sure!  

I can already imagine spending a lot of time with my cousin, taking her around to all these places and well-known coffee shops. I think those coffee shops are, like, one of the most unique things about Hanoi. So yeah, with all that in mind, I really believe Hanoi is the best choice out of the three options.

audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220055-2.ogg," In my opinion, if I have to choose between books, clothes and money, I would go for clothes, because a lot of children in remote, far-flung areas like Ha Giang or Ka Vang, they have to experience very long winters. And the most important thing that they need from the tragedies are the clothes. So that's why I hear a lot of donations for clothes for the children. And when the children have clothes, they can keep warm and have good health to continue their studies. And they will not suffer from any health problems, and they do not have to go to the hospital, so that their studies won't be interrupted. And the reason why I don't choose books is because we don't know which kind of books are really important for the children. So in order to choose the appropriate books for them, we have to carry out a survey. And it may take a long time. And if they have different demands for different kinds of books, we cannot meet all their needs. And also about the money, we all agree that money can help the children to have a good and healthy life. But we are not sure about whether the money could come to each child or not, because we hear a lot of problems with the money donation these days. Some local authorities, they give some parts of the money for themselves, and the money couldn't get to the children right there. So in conclusion, I think books are still the best choice for any charity to give donations to help children in far-flung areas, because of the above-mentioned reasons. And I hope that today we get a better life after the trips, after these charitable trips.","Okay, so if I had to choose between books, clothes, and money, I would definitely go with clothes. You know, there are a lot of kids in remote places like Ha Giang or Ka Vang, and they have to deal with really long, cold winters. I mean, the most important thing these kids need to survive those tough conditions is warm clothing. That's why I hear about so many donations for clothes for them.

When those kids have proper clothes, they can stay warm and it's better for their health, which helps them keep studying. I mean, if they’re warm and healthy, they won’t end up with health problems, so they won't have to take time off to go to the hospital. That way, their studies won’t get interrupted, and that’s super important.

Now, I didn’t pick books because we don’t really know what kind of books are most important for those kids. Like, to choose the right books, we’d need to do a survey or something, and that could take a long time. Plus, if the kids have different needs for different kinds of books, we just can’t meet all those demands easily.

And when it comes to money, I mean, we all know that it could help kids live healthier lives. But we can’t be sure it’ll actually get to each child. There’s been a lot of talk about issues with money donations lately, you know? I’ve heard that some local authorities keep part of the money for themselves, and then it doesn’t reach the kids who really need it. 

So, in conclusion, I really think clothes are the best option for charities wanting to help children in those far-off areas, based on everything I just mentioned. I really hope that after these charitable trips, we can help improve their lives.",9.0,9.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD1/audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220055-2.mp3,CD1,2

After you have graduated high school, you should go to university. University has a right to have a social skill in your life. You can have a good time with people around you and around the world. You will have some new friends. University helps you choose your prime measures you want to learn. You can help your jobs after you graduated your university in Vietnam. University education has changed from last 10 years to now. Many professors in our Vietnamese have students who know the right to be in the university. They can help the students choose what major they want to be comfortable with. Besides, some universities have good quality. Students want to go to university and develop themselves in their careers. I agree with this statement. University is the shortest way to succeed. If you want to go to university, you can learn about more people and people you can learn about the world. The skill will increase and make you confident in your life. If you want to go to university, you can decide your job opportunities. In the future, you can choose university to help people around you. You can help the right job in your life. That's all about my topic.","Okay, so I’m gonna talk about university education. You know, nowadays, university is super important in our lives. After you graduate high school, I really think you should go to university. It gives you the chance to learn social skills that are really useful. You can meet a lot of new people, like, not just around you, but from all over the world, which is pretty cool. Plus, you’ll make some new friends along the way.

University really helps you figure out what you want to study. It kind of sets you up for jobs after you graduate. In Vietnam, the whole university system has changed a lot over the last 10 years. A lot of professors now really understand how to guide students in choosing the right major, which is awesome. They help students find what they’re comfortable with, and that’s important.

Also, some universities have really good quality education, so students really want to go there to develop their careers. I totally agree with the idea that university is one of the shortest paths to success. You learn about so many people and different perspectives, and you get to learn about the world too. 

Those skills you pick up will definitely boost your confidence in life. If you decide to go to university, you’re setting yourself up with better job opportunities in the future.

audio/HUST281123Q63S167/HUST2811230038-3.ogg," Nowadays, soft skills are having some important roles in life, especially in job recruiting. The first advantage of soft skills is that it can increase job opportunities. Sometimes the employers don't need to see the professional skills of the candidate, but they focus on the soft skills of him because academic skills can be re-educated. The second benefit is the improvement of work performance. If we have ill soft skills, we might have a hardship in performance because sometimes we cannot communicate with others for the problems. And sometimes it can cause misunderstanding among people. The last but not least advantage is promoting relationships. If our soft skills are excellent, we can communicate with guests, even VIP guests of the company. We can also communicate better with the boss who gives you the deadlines. Sometimes you can score with the boss about your strong points. And also, you can let your boss or your college know what your weaknesses are and your strong points are. An example of the soft skills that I can mention is the presentation skills. I am a software developer and sometimes I need to present my project to my teachers so that they can give me grades or have some opinion to my project. If letting me improve soft skills for young people, I suggest the one that comes to my head first is always the communication skills. If you communicate with others good, they can understand you and sometimes they can become more emotional with you, with your hardships and your advantages. So that is my speaking test.","Okay, so, you know, nowadays soft skills are really important, especially when it comes to job recruiting. The first big advantage of soft skills is that they can actually open up more job opportunities. Like, sometimes employers don’t even look at your technical skills as much as they do your soft skills, because they know that you can always train someone in the technical stuff later on. 

Another benefit is that soft skills can really improve your work performance. If you don’t have good soft skills, you might struggle at work. Like, if you can’t communicate well with your coworkers, it can lead to misunderstandings and problems, which is no good at all.

And the last major point is that good soft skills help to build better relationships. If you’re good at communication, you can connect with guests—like, even VIP guests—much easier. You can also have better interactions with your boss, especially when it comes to discussing deadlines or your strengths and weaknesses. It’s really helpful to share what you’re good at and what you might struggle with.

An example of a soft skill I’d mention is presentation skills. I’m a software developer, and I often have to present my projects to my teachers so they can grade me or give feedback. If I had to suggest an important soft skill for young people to improve on, I’d definitely say communication skills. It’s just super essential; when you communicate well, people understand you better, and they can empathize with you over your challenges and your strengths.

She has had a great impact in my life and she has taught me many things which I can use for years to come. I am very honored to have been a student and to have been taught by her. So I want to make sure that I get her a gift which she can use for a very long time to remember me by. I have several options. A handbag, a pair of shoes, or a pair of glasses. When I weigh or compare these three items, I think about how she really loved to wear a handbag every day. I think for a teacher, a handbag is a very prized possession in that it can be used to store many things. Teachers also have to work on their feet quite a bit of the day, walking around in the classroom and teaching students. So it's essential to have a good pair of shoes that is comfortable. Furthermore, my teacher is of age and is in need of a pair of glasses. She has had the same pair of glasses for as long as I have known her, but I heard her complain the other day that she is due for a new pair. Now when I consider which pair, which present or gift would be the best to give her, I don't think a pair of glasses is the smartest choice. Only because I would need more information about the type of glasses that she needs. I also don't know what her shoe size is and I would need to gather that kind of information before the time so that I could buy her the perfect pair of shoes. I happened to walk by a store the other day and noticed that they had some handbags for sale. I remember that her favorite color is blue and this particular handbag came in three different colors. I think I'll get her a blue handbag, one with lots of zippers and pockets so she can store many different types of things like her school supplies and her papers and even her lunch. Also, the handbag seems to be the most cost effective for myself, being a student and not earning an income. So I think my choice will be the headband.","Okay, so since my teacher is retiring next summer, I really wanna make this gift special for her. She's had such a great impact on my life, you know? She’s taught me so many things that I can use for years. I'm actually really honored to be one of her students. So, I wanna make sure that whatever I get her is something she can use for a long time to remember me by.

I’ve got a few options in mind: a handbag, a pair of shoes, or a pair of glasses. When I think about these three items, I remember that she really loves to wear a handbag every day. I mean, for a teacher, a handbag is like a prized possession, right? It can hold all sorts of things, and it’s super practical.

Plus, teachers are always on their feet, walking around the classroom and teaching, so having a good pair of comfy shoes is really important too. Then there's the glasses. She's kind of older and I'm pretty sure she needs a new pair. I’ve seen her wear the same ones for as long as I can remember, and I even heard her mention the other day that she’s due for new ones.

But when I think about which gift would be the best, I feel like glasses might not be the smartest choice. I mean, I’d need to know what kind she needs, you know? And I don't know her shoe size either, so I'd have to find that out first to get her the perfect pair.

Anyway, I happened to walk by a store recently and saw some handbags on sale. I remember her favorite color is blue, and this particular handbag came in like, three different colors. So I think I’m gonna go with a blue handbag! One that has lots of zippers and pockets would be perfect, 'cause she can store all her school supplies, papers, and even her lunch in there.

audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-2.ogg," So it has been a super hectic week at work lately. So I am thinking about what I can do this weekend. I am thinking about 3 options. Whether to relax at home, to meet up with my friends or to go out with my family. But after some thinking, I am sure that I will relax at home. So if I relax at home, I don't have to dress up nicely, I do not have to put on makeup, I do not have to think about where to go, who to meet and what to talk to them about. So I have had a lot to think about this week. All the complexities at work, all the relationships to take care of. So on the weekend, I would want none of it. And another reason why I want to stay at home to relax is that I can't catch up with all the chores. It has been a pile of clothes that have not been folded, a lot of dishes that have not been washed. And my room has become a bit of a mess. So I want to stay the time to clean the environment that I live in. And even if I stay at home, I can invite my friends over to have a lovely dinner together. I mean just one friend, maybe my boyfriend who can help out with the chores as well. And I can cook something delicious for my family so that we can have some quality time for the other two options. I wouldn't want to meet with my friends because most of my friends are married now. So even if we meet, they would talk about their family and their kids mostly. And I have not a family of my own yet, so there's hardly anything to talk about. Before, my friends and I would go shopping. We could go to a favourite coffee shop and talk about lots of things. But this is not the case anymore, now that they have their own family. And for the third option to go out with my family, I mean this is super hard now to reserve a table at a restaurant or to book a trip away from the city. Because people want to escape the city so much that a lot of services have been booked already. So I only have Friday night to book everything and it would be super stressful. I mean I would spare the family trip until next time where we have much free time to spend. So in conclusion, my best choice for this weekend would be to relax at home, to do nothing and just rest. And after some rest, I can catch up with my chores, I can spend some quality time with the family and my boyfriend with a lovely and cozy dinner. And I think that would be enough for me to recharge after a busy week and prepare me for the next week. Thank you.","Okay, so it’s been a super hectic week for me at work, you know? So I’m like, okay, what am I gonna do this weekend? I have three options in mind: I could just chill at home, meet up with friends, or go out with my family. But honestly, after thinking about it a bit, I’m pretty sure I’m gonna just want to relax at home.

I mean, if I stay in, I don’t have to worry about dressing up nicely or putting on makeup. Plus, I won’t have to think about where to go, who to meet, or what to talk about. This week has just been so complicated with all the work stuff and relationships I have to juggle. So, on the weekend, I just wanna escape all of that.

Another thing is, I really need to catch up on my chores. My room is kinda messy right now, like I’ve got a pile of clothes that still need folding and a bunch of dishes that haven’t been washed yet. So, I think it’d be nice to take the time to clean up my space. And hey, even if I’m home, I can invite a friend over, maybe my boyfriend can help out too, and we can have a nice dinner. Cooking something delicious for my family and spending time together sounds really nice.

Honestly, meeting up with my friends isn’t my first choice right now since most of them are married. So, when we do hang out, it’s all about their families and kids, and I don’t really have that to relate to yet. Before, we used to go shopping and hang out at our favorite coffee shop, but now it just feels different with everyone’s new lives.

As for the family outing, it’s tough to make plans these days. Like, just trying to find a restaurant or book a little getaway can be a hassle. Everybody’s wanting to escape the city, so I’d probably end up stressed out trying to secure a reservation on Friday night. I think I’ll save that family trip for another time when we’ve got more free time.

So, yeah, in conclusion, my best option for this weekend is definitely to just relax at home, do nothing much, and rest. That way, I can catch up on my chores, enjoy some quality time with my family and boyfriend over a cozy dinner, and just recharge after this busy week. I think that sounds perfect for getting ready for the next week. Thanks!",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-2.mp3,CD15_3,2

It is expensive for a living room. It will be a big bedroom and a big bathroom. I think that is my dream house. I will talk about holiday destination. Last summer, I had a trip to Da Nang. I had a lot of fun.","Okay, so I live in a flat at 27 Chen Sihong Street. I moved there like, ten years ago when my parents bought a building on that street, you know? So I kinda had to move with them. Right now, I think there are a lot of advantages in my living room. Like, we have a garage for parking, which is super helpful 'cause you never really know where to park, right? And the elevator is really fast! I mean, when I'm tired or bored or even sad, it’s just quick to get home and help my parents out.

In my kitchen, we've got this amazing view. You can see the bridge and the street, and in the evening, it's really nice with all the people crossing over. There are lights everywhere, and I can just look down from there, and it's really beautiful. 

As for my dream house, well, I haven’t really thought about it yet, to be honest. But I do think that I’d like to buy a house in the future. It might be a bit of a pain to choose, like, two floors. I mean, the first floor has to be beautiful, right? And the kitchen needs to be modern, but it can get expensive for a living room. I’d want a big bedroom and a big bathroom too. So, I think that's kind of what my dream house looks like.

Now, let me tell you about my holiday destination. Last summer, I went on a trip to Da Nang, and honestly, I had a lot of fun!",8.0,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_1/audio/HUST311023JNFX167/HUST3110230033-1.mp3,CD16_1,1

For the first question, my favorite place is definitely Nha Trang beach. I went there about two years ago, and it's just such a beautiful and gorgeous beach in Vietnam. 

Now, for the second question, I've never really traveled alone, you know? I usually go with my family or friends. But, I mean, if I get the chance, I’d really like to travel alone at least once in my life. 

As for the third question, if I could spend my holiday this summer anywhere, I’d pick Katmai Island. I heard from my friends that it's a really beautiful place for summer because of the yellow sand and the blue sea. Plus, there are loads of enjoyable activities to do there. I really wish I could go!

Now, about public transport. So, for the first question, in the past, my main way of getting around was public transport, but I also have my own vehicle which is a motorcycle. I usually ride my motorcycle to school or work. 

For the second question, the most popular means of transport in my city is, believe it or not, the motorcycle. I live in Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam, and it's super crowded with vehicles and people. So, yeah, motorcycles are pretty much the main transport around here.

And, for the last question, using public transport has a lot of benefits. It’s inexpensive, convenient, fast, and it’s also environmentally friendly. So, that's pretty much it about my experiences!",8.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD12/audio/HUST2823DGI2167/HUST0208230031-1.mp3,CD12,1
audio/HUST2811234Q4J177/HUST2811230286-3.ogg," Well, I'm going to talk about visiting a foreign country can be a valuable experience for students. To me, there are a lot of benefits for these activities. First of all, visiting another country will allow you to increase your knowledge. It means that when you go to another country, you will understand the cultural perpetualism of this country. Like why this iconic is appear in this country, like the freedom of the myth of England. You understand why they have an attitude like that. That you never experience when you just live in the internet. Another reason, visiting a country will have good memories. Absolutely yes, because you can take photos with your family or your friends. You can save memories and preserve memories with photos. And experience when you try to find some culinary in this country. Actually, I think it's a new experience. You will keep memories and create long lasting memories for a long time. Another benefit of traveling to another country like you have more friends who come from another country. I think it's the way to raise the friendship bond. When you are making friends in another country, you can learn more language as well as understand the culture of them. And you gain a lot of experience and knowledge. About my own ideas, if I have a chance to travel to another country, I will love it. And I think visiting a foreign country is a dream of most students in Vietnam. Because we just practice basic theories without experience in daily life. And about the follow up questions. Actually, going abroad for holiday is not popular in Vietnam. I think the most individual who can go abroad on holiday is very in my country. First of all, we have a short holiday. And you know, in the holidays, the price of airplane tickets is very expensive. And so we cannot pay for them. And so most of them cannot pay for them. Regarding the traditional Vietnamese culture, we just want to come back to the home town and gather with my family and cooking. Yes, it's my more activities in my holiday. Not going abroad. Yeah.","Okay, so, I'm gonna talk about how visiting a foreign country can be, like, a really valuable experience for students. I mean, there are tons of benefits from this kind of activity. First off, when you visit another country, it really helps you increase your knowledge, right? Like, you get to understand the cultural aspects of that country. For example, you learn about why certain things are the way they are, like the whole idea of freedom in England. You get to see those attitudes firsthand, stuff you just wouldn't get from living behind a screen, you know?

Another reason is that traveling gives you amazing memories. Absolutely! You can take photos with your family or friends, and those photos help you save those moments. Plus, you get to try new foods that are unique to that country. Honestly, it's a whole new experience. You’ll create long-lasting memories that you'll treasure for a long time.

And, like, another benefit is that you meet all kinds of people from different countries. I think that really strengthens friendship bonds. When you make friends abroad, you also get to learn more languages and understand their cultures better, which is super enriching and gives you a lot of experience and knowledge.

As for my own thoughts, if I ever get the chance to travel to another country, I would totally love it. I think visiting another country is a dream for most students in Vietnam. Because honestly, we usually just practice basic theories without any real-life experience, you know?

Now, about the follow-up question. Actually, going abroad for a holiday isn’t that common in Vietnam. I think only a few people can afford to go abroad on vacation. First of all, we don’t really get long holidays. And during the holiday season, airplane tickets are, like, super expensive, so most people just can’t pay for them. Plus, in traditional Vietnamese culture, we prefer to go back to our hometowns to spend time with family and do a lot of cooking together. Yeah, that’s more of what we do during holidays, instead of going abroad.",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_3/audio/HUST2811234Q4J177/HUST2811230286-3.mp3,CD17_3,3
audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230243-3.ogg," I'm going to talk about the negative effects of a population. The first adverse effect I should mention is that with the limits you saw on earth, with the growing population, it will cause a negative effect. Because the number of population is growing, but the result of the earth is limited. So it may cause the lack of resources to apply, to provide to all the population. The second negative effect is that on the social, there will be less jobs for every, because if there are so many persons, maybe the job that can be created is not enough to provide to all the working class in the country. The third effect is the pressure on the infrastructure. With the growing number of people attracted to the city, it will cause a great pressure on the infrastructure. Just like the healthcare system, roads, streets, schools. I think to solve the problem of a population, the government or every person should focus on getting their people with the increasing number of people with a high level of education. They will be less likely to give a birth more. I think that the overpopulation problem is a thing that happens in developing countries more frequently than developed ones. Because in developed ones, people have more educated and they tend to not give a birth more frequently. Whereas in developing countries, people with lower education, they tend to give a birth more frequently and not any under control situation.","Okay, so I'm gonna talk about the negative effects of overpopulation. The first thing I wanna mention is that, you know, with the limits we have on Earth, a growing population can really cause some big problems. Like, the population is increasing, but our resources are pretty much fixed, right? So, this might lead to a shortage of resources that we need to, like, support everyone. 

The second negative effect is about jobs. If we have too many people, there might not be enough jobs for everyone. So, the job market gets kinda tight and that's not great for people looking to work. 

And then, the third point is about the pressure on infrastructure. With more people moving into cities, it puts a lot of stress on things like the healthcare system, roads, schools, you know, all that stuff. 

To tackle overpopulation, I think it’s super important for the government and everyone to focus on improving education. The more educated people are, the less likely they are to have a ton of kids. I feel like overpopulation is more of a problem in developing countries than in developed ones, you know? In developed countries, people are generally more educated and they tend to have fewer children. But in developing countries, it’s often the opposite—people with less education tend to have more kids without much control over the situation.",9.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230243-3.mp3,CD16_3,3
audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-1.ogg," Good morning Madam, I would like to start my speaking test now. First let's talk about my dating experience. Of course I like dating, I'm a young person, I would love to get to know new people of different genders, but of course I would prefer men for sure. I have dated several people, my boyfriend now is a very kind person, we work in the same company, he is more senior than me, he knows a lot about his work, but he also spends quality time with his family. That is what I like about him, he cares a lot for his mother, his father has passed away, but he cares a lot for his mother, his sisters, and all his nieces and nephews. I would like to prepare for a date to be successful. Previously I would prepare a lot for clothes and make up, but now I would just make sure to be comfortable, to be myself. Even if I have been busy all day long at work, I would stop at 5pm or 6pm to go home, to take a rest, to put on light make up and comfortable clothes, and to be on time for my date. I believe that if I am comfortable I can share about myself better with my date, and that my boyfriend would feel at ease with me as well, so that we can have quality time forgetting about all the stress. Now let's turn to talk about radio. To be fair, for people, my generation, we wouldn't listen to the radio as much, so now I don't listen to the radio anymore. I would listen more to post guests on YouTube, or Spotify, or iTunes, and something more relevant to my generation now. But I remember I listened to the radio a lot when I took the bus to high school, like 10 years ago. But I believe that radios are still useful to its audience. Sometimes when I drive the car with my mum, we would listen to radio channels, we would listen to news about real estate. So I believe that radio channels are more for mature audiences who have lots of money to invest. So I think the radio is really beneficial for people who don't have much time, but want to listen to really quality news.","Good morning, Madam! I’d like to start my speaking test now. So, first off, let’s chat about my dating experience. Honestly, I really enjoy dating. I'm young and, you know, I love meeting new people, especially guys. I've dated a few people in the past, but my current boyfriend is really kind. We actually work together at the same company, and he's more senior than me, so he really knows his stuff. But what I like most is that he makes time for his family. He really cares about his mom, especially since his dad has passed away. He’s there for his sisters and all his nieces and nephews too.

Now, when I’m getting ready for a date, I like to prepare well. A while ago, I used to stress a lot about my clothes and makeup. But these days, I focus on being comfortable and just being myself. Even if I’ve had a hectic day at work, I make it a point to wrap up around 5 or 6 PM, go home, take a little break, put on some light makeup, and wear comfy clothes. I think it’s really important to be relaxed so I can be open and share about myself better. I want my boyfriend to feel at ease too, so we can really enjoy our time together and forget about any stress.

Now, moving on to radio! To be honest, for people my age, we don’t really listen to the radio much anymore. I mean, I don’t listen to it at all these days. I’m more into podcasts on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, or iTunes—stuff that feels more relevant to my generation, you know? But I do remember listening to the radio a lot while taking the bus to high school, like, ten years ago. 

That said, I do believe radio still serves its purpose for some folks. Whenever I’m driving with my mom, we often tune into radio channels to catch up on news, especially about real estate—or whatever’s going on. So I think radio is more geared toward older audiences, especially those who have some money to invest. It's definitely useful for people who might not have a lot of time, but still want to catch some quality news.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230204-1.mp3,CD15_3,1

There are three suggestions here, a sports glove, a music glove and an art and art grad glove. So I would like to discuss about the music glove first. I think it's very interesting that you can play it or you can talent for singing, to sing or to play a musical instrument. However, this glove will require you a lot of contribution in terms of time when you join in this. So for example, you have to pay for about 40 hours per week to join this music glove and also about 5 hours of performance each year with an art and art glove. So it is quite a good choice. However, yes, generally the art and craft gloves will hold the voluntary trip to the removed area to have the ethnic people here. But yes, it's going to require you a lot of time and you even have to bring your work to your home to finish after the deadline of this club. A sports glove is that you should take this sport glove in consideration because it's well good for your health. There are a lot of sports here for you to choose. You can freely choose and the price to join in this club is up to the sport that you choose it. So overall, I think and I suppose that the best choice is regarding first to your pursuer, your leisure pursuer. However, there are times and also these, the time for you to party and you need to balance from your club work to your study. So I think the sport glove is most suitable for you because it will have the freely time to join any club and this will be for you during the ethnic of the team. I don't think this music glove and the art and art glove is not interesting. However, yes, you taste your taken this be there are problems into considerations.","Okay, so I wanna give you some advice on these questions, and I've got three suggestions for you. There's a music club, an arts and crafts club, and then there's a sports club. So, let’s talk about the music club first, alright? I mean, I think it's really cool if you have a talent for singing or playing an instrument. But, you know, this club is gonna need quite a bit of your time. Like, you might need to commit about 40 hours a week to it, plus around 5 hours of performances each year. So, it’s a nice option, but it's a big time commitment. 

Then there’s the arts and crafts club. They usually do some volunteer trips to remote areas to work with ethnic communities, which is pretty amazing, you know? But again, it’s gonna take a lot of your time, and you might even have to take some of your work home to finish after deadlines. 

Now, the sports club is definitely worth considering too because it's great for your health. There are a bunch of different sports you can choose from, and the cost to join really depends on what sport you pick. 

So, to sum it all up, I think the best choice really depends on what you’re into and how you like to spend your free time. It’s also super important to find a balance between your club activities and your studies. I feel like the sports club might be the most suitable for you because it gives you more freedom to participate without the heavy time commitment like the other clubs. I’m not saying the music and arts clubs aren’t interesting—they totally are! But, you gotta think about the time you can actually dedicate to each.",8.5,9.0,9.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC167/HUST3110230135-2.mp3,CD16_2,2

Minh, I think that the thing that makes me a good friend is that we have a good ethical and have a good both of active and equal. That is what makes me to admire him. I am talking about my high school days. I think that my time in high school is a wonderful time because of some reason. Firstly, at high school, I can make a new friend, broaden my connection and my knowledge. Also, in my school, I met many people like my teacher, my advisor. They convey to me a lot of meaningful lectures in my school days. I think that the most subject that I like is mathematics because it requires a lot of critical thinking. We need a lot of practical at home to learn it well. I think that my school days are well except that there are not enough supplements for the school days. When we have a lot of students, we don't have enough chairs or enough tables to serve everyone. A lot of students have to stand to listen to some content that we convey in the school days.","Okay, so let me tell you about my best friend, Minh.

First off, in high school, I got to make a bunch of new friends and really broaden my connections and knowledge. I met some amazing people, like my teachers and my advisor, who shared a lot of meaningful lessons with me during those years. 

Honestly, my favorite subject has to be math. I really like it 'cause it makes you think critically and a lot of the time you need to practice at home to get it right. Overall, I think my school days were pretty great, but there was one issue. There didn't seem to be enough supplies for all the students. Like, when we had a lot of us in class, there weren’t enough chairs or tables for everyone. Some students even had to stand up just to listen to the lessons, which kinda made things tough.

Pretty very precise. I like the way that the weather is forecast in my country. I have been to a library to find some books I need for my thesis. People always go to the library to study, to read books they want and they discuss together about the problems they had. I think we can provide free books for everyone but we have to get some sorts to take the profit for the library to maintain the activity. Maybe they can have more income such as renting some space in the library for the other purpose. Maybe another way to provide free books is you have to collect all the necessary books that everyone is concerned about that. And they will come to your library.","Okay, so like, the weather in my country right now is kinda sunny and a bit cloudy, you know?

So, I recently went to the library to find some books I need for my thesis. A lot of people go to the library to study, read what they want, and just discuss problems they’ve got. I think it'd be great if we could give out free books to everyone, but, you know, we’d need some kind of funding to keep the library running. Maybe they could earn more money by renting out space in the library for other events or stuff like that. Another idea for providing free books is, like, collecting all the essential books that people are really interested in.

audio/HUST24223GHH9166/HUST2402230035-3.ogg," In my opinion, there are some factors that could contribute to a person feeling happy. Firstly, I believe that stronger friendships is what makes us feel excited and happy. For example, whenever I feel down in the dumps and need a friend who can... Whenever I feel down in the dumps and need somebody to share my inner most worries and thoughts with, I could always find some close friends who I can really trust to share my problems with, being in the knowledge that the friends could always have my best interests attached and give me the most honest pieces of advice possible. When I'm in difficult situations, I could always be confident in the knowledge that I could call my friends and ask them to come over and give me a hand. What's more, the sense of belonging is also what could make me feel happy. Because I feel like after a lengthy and exhausting day at work, being able to come back home to spend time with my family and my puppy could always make me feel miraculously cathartic and therapeutic. I also believe that I feel happy if I could achieve a certain success at work, for example, being promoted to a higher precision or receiving high salaries. Therefore, I always feel unhappy if I could not fulfill all the tasks I have at work and therefore could not receive bonuses at the end of the month or could not be promoted to a higher precision. Peer pressure is what really pushes me to work hard at work and if I could not achieve a certain amount of success at work, I could not compare myself with my friends and therefore would feel super disappointed. I do believe that childhood is the happiest time in a person's life because when we were children, we were not saddled with work responsibilities and family commitments. Therefore, we have the peace of mind and the total freedom to do whatever we want without having to worry too much. By contrast, as a dower, we always have to think about our family, our job and therefore never be in the right frame of mind to enjoy life to the fullest. Finally, in my opinion, money is a very important factor in achieving happiness because money could allow us to provide our family with better living standards. When other family members are happy, I believe that we also feel very happy.","Okay, so I wanna talk about what makes a person feel happy, you know? I think there are a few things that really contribute to our happiness. First off, I believe that having strong friendships is super important. Like, whenever I’m feeling down in the dumps and just need someone to talk to, I can always reach out to my close friends. I really trust them to share my worries and thoughts with, ‘cause I know they have my back and give me honest advice. It’s such a relief knowing that I can call them if I’m in a tough spot, and they’ll come over and help me out.

Also, the sense of belonging is a big one for me. After a long and exhausting day at work, just being able to come home and hang out with my family and my puppy is, like, the best feeling ever. It’s so cathartic and therapeutic, you know? 

And I also think that achieving success at work plays a role in my happiness. Like, getting promoted or earning a higher salary feels really fulfilling. But then, if I’m not able to complete all my tasks or if I don’t get bonuses at the end of the month, it honestly makes me feel pretty unhappy. There’s this peer pressure to succeed, and if I can’t measure up to my friends, I end up feeling really disappointed.

You know, I truly believe that childhood is the happiest time in our lives. When we’re kids, we don’t have work responsibilities or family commitments weighing us down. We just have that peace of mind and freedom to do what we want without stressing too much. But as adults, we’re always thinking about our jobs and families, and it can be hard to enjoy life to the fullest.

Finally, money’s also a pretty important factor in happiness for me. I mean, it allows us to provide our families with better living standards, right? And when the people we care about are happy, I think that makes us feel happy too. So, yeah, those are a few things I think are key to feeling happy!",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_1/audio/HUST24223GHH9166/HUST2402230035-3.mp3,CD7_1,3
audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230073-3.ogg," So to me, the work of a group in the school is really necessary because we have some projects. We need to have groups like four or five people can discuss about this issue and give them ideas to solve the problem. To me, it's really, really hard to learn because more people, more ideas, we can get many ways to reach the issue of the project we have. But, besides that, I think we have some disadvantages about the work like a group. Because when we have five people, for example, when we have five people in the group, sometimes we will have some people lazy and they don't give their opinion. They just listen to their ideas of another people and it's not good for them because if they don't give their opinion, they will not improve themselves. So, I think working with a group has a problem because it's really hard to connect the ideas together to solve the project. For example, each people has a different idea. They cannot connect it to how to find a good point to get a goal. So, to me, I think the teacher needs to explain and help them to know about the work like a group activity. Because the teacher needs to find someone to control the group, like a leader. Because the leader has the member of group to be easy to catch the idea and understand the idea of each other. And the leader needs to take note of each idea and respect their idea to help them keep their point to make the idea to solve the problem. So, I think the teacher needs to understand the idea of each of the groups. So, I think the teacher needs to understand the idea of each of the groups.","So, to me, doing group work in school is super important because we have these projects, right? You really need groups of, like, four or five people to discuss the issues and brainstorm ideas to solve the problems. I mean, it's definitely harder to learn on your own. With more people, you get more ideas, and that opens up a lot of different ways to tackle the project we have.

But on the flip side, there are some downsides to group work. Like, when you have, say, five people in a group, sometimes you get folks who are kinda lazy and they don’t offer their own opinions. They just sit back and listen to what everyone else says, and that’s not really good for them, you know? If they don’t share their thoughts, they won't grow or improve.

And then there’s the challenge of connecting everyone's ideas together to solve the project. Each person might have a different perspective, and it can be tough to find that common ground to reach a goal. So, I really think the teacher should help guide us with group activities. They ought to pick someone to be the group leader, you know? The leader can help organize everyone’s ideas and make it easier for group members to catch on to each other’s points.

That leader also needs to take notes on everyone's ideas and respect what each person brings to the table, which helps keep everyone engaged and working towards solving the problem. So, yeah, I think it’s crucial for teachers to pay attention to what each group is doing and understand their ideas. It just makes the whole process smoother, you know?",8.0,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_1/audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230073-3.mp3,CD11_1,3

The professor does not care about the time we go to the school, we go to the class and we are independent on our own. We are not worried about the materials, the teamwork and so on. Moreover, during the summer we have a chance to gain a lot of necessary skills like communication skills, solving problem skills and teamwork skills. Besides, we also study a lot of knowledge, not only the professional but also the basis. That's all is really important to everyone for preparing for the future work. The most memorable about my university time is I had more opportunity to take part in many clubs and activities like volunteering or dancing in university. Now my university is not the same as they were in the past because it is nowadays universities are equipped with modern facilities and experience, teachers to support student learning. In my perspective, university in Vietnam should add to their curriculum. Now the university has many social networking to help people when they encounter difficulties. In conclusion, university is a memorable time of our lives and we will not forget it. Thank you.","Okay, so I wanna talk about how university is, like, a super memorable time in our lives for a bunch of reasons. First off, when you're studying at university, you get this freedom, right? Like, the professors aren't checking in on you about when you come to class or what time you show up — you're kind of independent and on your own. And you're not really stressing about materials or teamwork all the time.

Plus, during summer breaks, you get this chance to pick up really important skills, you know? Things like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. And it’s not just about the professional stuff; we also learn the basics. All of that is super important for preparing us for our future jobs.

The thing that stands out the most about my university experience is how I got to join lots of clubs and activities, like volunteering and dancing, which was awesome. Now, universities these days, they’re not the same as they used to be. They have all these modern facilities and experienced teachers to help students learn better.

From my point of view, I think universities in Vietnam should improve their curriculums even more. Nowadays, they also have social networks to help students when they’re facing difficulties.

So, yeah, in conclusion, university really is a memorable time in our lives that we won’t forget. Thanks for listening!",8.0,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD10_2/audio/HUST30523GBJG167/HUST3005230144-3.mp3,CD10_2,3

But if I have to choose one, it should be a conical hat because my foreign teacher, she is female and she has a very fashionable wearing style. And I consider her as a face-in-the-store in my school, so a conical hat should be a fit to her. About the package, coffee, I guess is not quite suitable because once she told me that she likes a leaf, so if she drinks coffee, I think it's not good for her health and I can eliminate that option immediately. I have an in-brush picture, I think she will like it but it's not as good as a hat. A picture, she can absolutely hang in her apartment but she already has a fulfilled house. Once I go to her house, I saw that she hangs a lot of flowers, decorations or pictures around her house on the walls. So I don't think she will need another picture to be a decoration. In fact, a conical hat would suit her. She loves wearing hats and she even has a really big collection of every type of hat with many colors and I'm sure she will like it. This is our idea. I will ask my friends to have more advice if she likes a hat or a picture but I think the best choice is the hat.","Okay, so, to be honest, I've gotta confess that I’ve never really bought a gift for a foreigner, so I’m not super sure what they like. But if I had to choose something, I think it would be a conical hat. My foreign teacher, she’s a woman and has this really fashionable style, you know? I see her as kind of a trendsetter at my school, so I think a conical hat would really suit her. 

Now, about coffee, I don’t think that would be a good idea because she once mentioned that she prefers tea. So, if coffee's not good for her, I can just cross that option off the list right away. As for a painting, I think she might like that, but honestly, it doesn’t compare to the hat. I mean, a picture is nice and all, and she could hang it up in her apartment, but her place is pretty much already filled with decorations. When I went to her house, I saw that she has a lot of flowers and pictures all over the walls. It’s like a little gallery, so I doubt she needs another piece of art.

Honestly, I really think the conical hat would fit her perfectly. She loves hats and has this massive collection in so many colors, I’m pretty sure she’d like it. So, that’s my idea. I might check with my friends too, to see if they think she’d prefer a hat or a picture.

And usually I buy pork, beef, vegetables, and some fruits like bananas and guava for my meal. From my perspective, I think going to the market can help me to have a better understanding of what is going on outside and I can know the market, I can know what is the price going up or going down. And of course, last but not least, going to the market helps me to get my food and cooking for myself is better than eating outside. And let's talk about music festival. Usually music festival is not my cup of tea. My friend invited me to participate in some music festival but I'm not really curious about that. As I mentioned before, I don't want to go to music festival so I haven't decided if I'm alone or I will go with my friend. Yeah sure, I don't like festival music but for other people I think festival music is a place surrounded with many people and people can interact with each other. That environment is good for people to recharge themselves and get refreshed and get more energy for the coming working week or in the music festival. You also can make friends with someone else and have fun.","Okay, so I often go to the market 'cause I'm living on my own and, like, I need to grab some ingredients for my meals, you know?

What I like most about the wedding party is we can enjoy and can share the beautiful moment with all of our beloved ones and it is the moment that we both become wife and husband to come to the same home and I always from the beginning always want to wear a suit, black and white, the classic one too when I attend the wedding party. In Vietnamese actress, my favorite one is Hảng Anh and she is young and beautiful woman who is very talented in acting. So in my opinion, what I would address is she can become a person who can become completely knows about the emotion, who can make it very truly went in the film so people can feel it and the movie industry in Vietnam is not widely developed because it is still very poor and we need to pay more attention and more fund to develop in.","Okay, so I’ve been to a lot of weddings, you know, my friends' and my best friend's wedding in Hanoi and honestly, I think they're beautiful ceremonies.

Now, talking about Vietnamese actresses, my favorite is Hằng Anh. She’s a young and beautiful woman, really talented in acting. I think what makes her stand out is she really knows how to convey emotions in her performances. You can feel what she’s portraying in the films.

I think that's because fast food is convenient and also they are quite delicious. Although I do not like fast food very much, but I have to admit that they are quite delicious. But obviously they are not good for our health. So there are some ways to reduce the consumption of fast food. I think the first and the most important way of doing that is raising your self-awareness about your health. Maybe fast food is convenient and they are not harmful. Their effect is not feasible in the short term, but they will have a very adversary effect to your health in the long run. So if you can pay more attention to your health and raising your awareness about the harms of fast food, you can prevent yourself from using them too much. Other ways can be if you are not too busy and you should plan your meals carefully with clean and healthy food. Also try to avoid getting too hungry. Because when we are hungry and we want to eat as soon as possible, fast food is the fastest and the most convenient way of getting the hunger out. And that is directly related to how you can plan your meals carefully. Because if you can have time to plan your meals every day, then there should be a lower chance that you can get too hungry at any time. So I think there are several ways for people to reduce their consumption of fast food.","Okay, so recently, you know, the trend of eating fast food is like really growing popular among people. I think it’s mainly because fast food is super convenient and, honestly, it kinda tastes good too. I mean, even though I don’t really like fast food that much, I gotta admit it does taste pretty nice. But, let’s face it, it’s not really good for our health. 

So, I guess there are a couple of ways to kinda reduce how much fast food we eat. Like, the first and most important way is really just to raise your self-awareness about your health. I mean, yeah, fast food is convenient and might not seem harmful right away, but, you know, in the long run, it can really mess with your health. If you pay more attention to your health and understand the harms of fast food, I think you can definitely stop yourself from eating it too much.

Another way is, if you’re not too busy, you should really try to plan your meals ahead with clean and healthy food, right? And also, try to avoid getting too hungry. Because you know when you’re starving, you just wanna eat something quick, and fast food is like the quickest option out there. So that really connects to meal planning too. If you take the time to plan your meals every day, you’re less likely to get super hungry at random times.

So yeah, I think there are a bunch of ways for people to cut down on fast food.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC177/HUST3110230170-3.mp3,CD16_2,3
audio/HUST6923DQQK166/HUST0609230107-3.ogg," Yes, today I'm going to talk about the topic school life is the best time in our life. For me, school life is the best time in our life because of some reason. First is the knowledge achievement. In the school, we can study a lot of things that we don't know and we are hungry to know about this knowledge. And also in the school, every teacher we have wants to share their experience and their knowledge with us. So we just have many friends and many teachers who share their knowledge with us. So the school life is the best time for us to gain our knowledge and broaden our knowledge as well. Secondly, the life in the school, we can make a lot of friends and some of them, it's become the last forever. So in the school, we can find a lot of friends and these friends can share their experience with them and we can have more time to spend with them in the school. Therefore, maybe some of them can become lifelong friendships and who will go with us for the long time in our life. The other reason that the school life may be the best time in our life is the no financial burden. At the school, most of the students can get the cover patiently from their parents. So for example, when I'm going to the university, my parents pay the rent for me and also the school fee for me. That's why I don't need to pay too much on the finance and I also have more time to spend it, to study and make friends as well. At the school, I also have a part-time job. That can help me to have more money to live on my own. At the school life, I think it's also the best because we have more time to spend for our life, to live on my own, to do whatever I like and to hang out with my friends instead of thinking about how to earn money, how to get a job. At the school, we also can learn a new skill that may be useful for the next step of our life, such as at the university, we can choose the major that we like the most and learn about it. After that, apply this knowledge to do the new job in the next step. That's all of my topic I want to talk about.","Okay, so today I’m gonna talk about why I think school life is the best time in our lives. For me, it’s the best, you know, for a couple of reasons. First off, there’s all the knowledge we get. In school, we get to learn so many things that we wouldn’t normally know about, especially since we’re all curious and hungry to learn. Plus, every teacher we have is there to share their experiences and knowledge with us. So, it's like we’re surrounded by friends and teachers who are all about helping us grow. It really is the best time to gain knowledge and broaden our horizons.

Secondly, school is just a great place to make friends. Some of these friendships, you know, they can last forever. In school, we meet tons of people, and we share experiences with them. We spend so much time together that who knows, some of these friendships might stick with us for the long haul.

Another reason why school life rocks is that there’s no financial burden on us—well, for most students, anyway. Typically, our parents cover a lot of our expenses. Like, when I go to university, my parents pay my rent and my school fees, so I don’t have to stress too much about money. I can focus more on studying and making friends without constantly worrying about finances. Sure, I may take on a part-time job later on to help me live more independently, but, you know, at school, it feels more relaxed.

And hey, in school, we also get the chance to learn new skills that will help us later in life. For instance, when we reach university, we can choose our majors based on what we’re really interested in and dive deep into those subjects. After that, we can apply all that knowledge to land good jobs later on.

So, yeah, that’s everything I wanted to share about why I think school life is just the best time of our lives.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_2/audio/HUST6923DQQK166/HUST0609230107-3.mp3,CD13_2,3

Which kinda rules out Hanoi since it's summer in Hanoi. Why would you want to go there? It's really hot! The best season for Hanoi is about autumn, when it's not too hot, and since it's not winter yet, it's not cold. Which rules out Hanoi entirely. Super and Alert. Super is best visit around spring and winter since it's the coldest place in the country. There's snow and place, and since you're leaving England, you know how that is. So, if you want to visit for the cold shower, I guess it's okay, but not really the best place. In my opinion, the best place would be in the alert. Now, the place is rich in culture since it was really a good place. I mean, the French dominated the area and then they put the ballot as a real bridge, pretty much their resort. They built stuff there, they built a lot of infrastructure, and the place there is really beautiful. And since it's the summer, it's not rainy at all. It's very clean, it doesn't have rain. Yeah, there's no rain, so since you're from England, there's no rain at all. The weather is nice, sunny, there's a lot of sun there. And the weather is pretty cool, pretty chill this time of the year, it's in the summer. So, not too chilly, summer, the weather however is going to be a problem since the... I mean, depends on what form of shower you want, but you have to fly to Da Nang and then drive there. But yeah, Da Nang is a very nice place just for the summer since it's very chill, the people are nice, the coffee is nice. And there's a lot of places to visit, so the scenery as well. I mean, there's not a lot of endless culture in there, so you would see a lot of French architecture. And since Da Nang is a nice place if you want to visit other places that have a lot of rich culture as well since they're very close. Da Nang is about an hour away, which is very nice to drive there. So, see ya. It's very close by, and also it's close to the sea as well. Like, two hours away, very nice. I recommend it that lot.","So, okay, we've got three choices, right? We've got Hanoi, Super, and Alert. And since you're planning to go on summer vacation, which is, what, around July to August? I guess that kinda rules out Hanoi 'cause, I mean, it's super hot there in the summer! The best time to visit Hanoi is really in the autumn when it’s not too hot and it hasn’t gotten cold yet. So yeah, definitely not the best time for Hanoi. 

Now, let's talk about Super and Alert. Super is actually best to visit in spring or winter ‘cause it’s the coldest place in the country. There’s, like, snow there, which I know is a big deal since you're leaving England and you get enough of that cold already! So, if you're looking for a really cold shower experience, I guess it could work, but it’s not really the top spot.

In my opinion, the best choice would be Alert. That place has a rich culture, ya know? It was really influenced by the French back in the day, and they built a lot of cool stuff there. The architecture is beautiful, and since you're going in the summer, it’s pretty dry and clean — like, no rain at all! I mean, if you’re from England, you’ll appreciate the nice sunny weather. The temperatures are pretty chill this time of year, not too hot either.

Now, just keep in mind, the weather can be a bit tricky depending on what kind of climate you want, but you'll have to fly into Da Nang and then drive from there. But Da Nang is a really nice spot for the summer — it’s super chill, the people are friendly, and the coffee's great! Plus, there’s plenty to see, you know? 

So, while there may not be endless culture in Da Nang itself, you’ll find a lot of French architecture, and it’s close to other culturally rich places too. It’s only about an hour drive away, so that's not bad at all. And it’s also pretty close to the sea—like, just two hours away. I really recommend it.

It's very hard for me to get up early in the morning and I feel very tired when I have to get up early in the morning. But at night I always feel like I have a lot of energy to do everything and I get more creative at night. The idea just came bursting through my head when I'm sitting around in my bed brainstorming about what I can be doing for the next experiment in my physics class for example. While working I can perform very well under stress and also I think that I can work well individually. However, I appreciate the fact that I always have a team supporting me and I have to admit that I'm a team player. The benefit of working as part of a team is that you always have someone to back you up. You feel like you always have someone at your back and someone is always there for you to support you. That makes me feel more relieved and gets me through the working days as I have my team with me. Also, working as part of a team, so having teammates or having co-workers, makes me more relaxed during working hours. Not relaxed to the point that I procrastinate, but more knowing that you have social interaction and not just work, work, work during your day. While working I really appreciate the type of people who I can talk to. For example, when it comes to my supervisor, I would love for my supervisor, he or she, to really try and listen to me. I want to work with the kind of people who I can communicate and who are willing to listen to my ideas even though we might have disagreements. The fact that the people who show respect to me and show that they are willing to listen to my ideas are very important to me. That is what I find much in the past.","So, I have to say, I'm definitely a night person, not really a morning person at all.

When I'm working, I actually perform really well under stress, but I also think I work nicely on my own. Although, I really appreciate having a team around me.

It feels nice knowing there’s someone at your back who’s there to support you. That really helps me get through my workdays, having my team with me.

Also, working with teammates or co-workers makes it a bit more relaxed during the work hours. Not to the point of procrastinating or anything, but it’s just nice knowing I get to interact with others, instead of just sitting there doing work, work, work all day.

audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230017-2.ogg," When it comes to buying clothes between the three places, a shop, an open-air market, and an online store, I think the best choice for me is the online store. Of course, these three suggestions have different advantages and disadvantages. For a shop, you can buy many stuff. It has all the brands, all the sizes. It's easier to find a size that fits you. Because sometimes when you go to an open-air market, the price might be cheaper. But sometimes you will find it difficult to find the clothes that suit you. It's also the same for an online store when you want to buy something but you don't know it will fit you. So a shop could be great for someone who wants to buy something that is difficult to select the size. About the open-air market, I think one thing about an open-air market is that it is sometimes cheaper. And also there will be some clothes that will be very difficult to find in the shop because they are not working on a brand. But to me, an online store is the best choice. So why is that? Because an online store has an official brand. So for example, Shopee and Lazada have an official brand. So you can get a nice discount on the online store during their discount season. Sometimes it's even cheaper than in the shop and in an open-air market. Another thing about an online store is that even though you don't know if the clothes will fit you, it also provides some measurements so that you can compare it with your body. Another thing about an online store is that it is very effective in time. You will spend a little time checking all the brands, checking all the clothes that the store has. And you also can compare between online shops so that you can find the best deal for your clothes. Another thing that I really like about online stores is that instead of spending time all morning and afternoon to get to a shop, you can just press a click and the clothes will be sent to you right away.","Okay, so when we're talking about buying clothes, you know, between a shop, an open-air market, and an online store, I think the online store is definitely the best choice for me. So, all three places kinda have their own pros and cons. 

If you go to a shop, you can find a ton of stuff, right? Like, they have all the brands and sizes, which makes it easier to, like, figure out what fits you. But when you check out an open-air market, yeah, the prices might be cheaper, but sometimes it’s tough to find clothes that really suit you, you know? It can be tricky. It's kinda the same with online shopping—you can buy things, but you can't really try them on, and that can be a gamble. So, I think a shop is great if you really need to get the right size for something.

Now, when it comes to open-air markets, what's cool is that sometimes they do have cheaper options, plus you might find unique clothes that you wouldn't see in regular shops since, like, they’re not branded stuff. But honestly, I still prefer shopping online. 

Why? Well, online stores often have official brands like Shopee and Lazada, and they sometimes offer awesome discounts during sales. I mean, it can even end up being cheaper than what you'd find in a shop or at an open-air market. Plus, a lot of online stores give you measurements, so you can compare them with your own body measurements to see if it’ll fit.

Another thing I really like about online shopping is it saves a ton of time. Instead of spending all morning or afternoon wandering around a mall or market, you can just click a few buttons and check all the brands and styles from the comfort of your home. And, like, you can easily compare different online shops to find the best deal on what you want. 

So, yeah, I definitely prefer online stores just for that convenience factor—you can order what you like and have it sent right to your door. It’s super easy!",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230017-2.mp3,CD9_1,2
audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220016-2.ogg," Smoking is a bad habit and it is not healthy for anybody. So I would suggest that the government should ask smokers to do community service. My reason for choosing this option is that I think it is the best option amongst the other two that are given. When people smoke in public, they affect the community. In the sense that they don't think about other people, they do it around other people not considering how other people feel or if those other people they smoke around are smokers. As a non-smoker, I personally don't like it when people smoke around me because I know how this is going to affect my lungs and yet I do not smoke. So asking smokers to do community service would show them that what they are doing in the community is wrong. This will give them more time to reflect on their act. I am saying this is a better option because if they were to pay a fine of $500,000, it doesn't stop them from smoking. They will do it over and over again knowing very well that all they have to do is pay a fine and then they can go back to smoking. I did not choose the option of sending smokers to prison because currently there is no law in place that states that if one smokes in public, they will be sent to prison. If that law was put in place, then cigarettes would not be allowed into the country and cigarettes would not be sold to the people and the public at large. So as I have said, my best option is to ask smokers to do community service so they have time to reflect on the bad they are doing to the community, how it affects the community and what they can do to stop them.","Okay, so, like, smoking is definitely a bad habit, right? It’s just not healthy for anyone. So what I think is, the government should have smokers do community service. I mean, my reason for picking this option is that I really think it’s the best one compared to the other two given options. 

When people smoke in public, it's like they really affect the whole community. They don’t think about others, you know? They just smoke around people without considering how it makes others feel, or if the people nearby even smoke. As a non-smoker myself, I gotta say, I really don’t like it when folks smoke around me. I mean, I know how bad it can be for my lungs, and yet I’m not smoking at all!

So having smokers do community service would let them see that what they're doing is actually wrong. It gives them a chance to think about their actions. I think this is way better than just making them pay a fine of $500,000 because, honestly, that doesn’t stop them from smoking. They just pay the fine and then go back to smoking again, right? 

And I didn’t go for the option of sending smokers to prison. I mean, right now, there’s no law that says if you smoke in public, you’ll get sent to prison. If there was such a law, it would mean cigarettes couldn’t be brought into the country, and people wouldn’t be able to buy them anymore.

So yeah, just to wrap it up, I really think the best option is to have smokers do community service. It gives them time to reflect on how their smoking affects the community and what they can do about it.",8.0,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220016-2.mp3,CD3,2

And then just towards the end of the day, the weather changes, it becomes very, very, very cold until late in the evenings. So you never really know what the weather would be like during the week because it's difficult to predict. The forecast users would say that the weather would be hot and then it only turns out to be something completely different. So it's quite confusing. I like the way the weather forecast is in my country because as it gets cold, it does not get extremely cold to a point of snow. We don't experience snow in Botswana. So when it gets cold, the weather is still bearable. So you can still go outside in winter and just have a normal day. Then when it gets hot, it also gets really, really, really hot to the point of having like extreme heat waves, which is really not a good thing because people get affected, the plants get affected, the animals get affected, everything just gets affected.

Like, I mean, you can literally see the weather change like, twice in a single day. For example, in the morning it can be super hot—like, extremely hot.

audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230254-3.ogg," Oh well today I am going to talk about fast food. Of course fast food is harmful to our health because of some reasons. Firstly it makes skin weight because it contains you know much sugar and it's too salty sometimes so it's not good for our health and for example my sister used to like KFC and after a week she gained about two kilograms after that she had to cut down on it. Secondly fast food lacks nutrition for sure because fast food contains meat, sausages and we cannot see vegetables or fresh milk fresh vegetables are fresh food in in the fast food restaurant so it's of course lack of nutrients. We cannot have a balanced diet with a fast food and if we have fast food for a long time we can face many diseases like obesity and heart attack. Because when we eat fast food our blood can raise height and we cannot control and fast food is very delicious I cannot deny the attraction of fast food and we cannot stop eating it and after a long time eating fast food we can get fatter and we can face obesity and and to be more serious we can have some heart problems and heart attack is one of the most serious problem we can have if we try fast food day by day. Last but not least fast food makes us become dependent. You know that when we come to a fast food restaurant means we it means that we don't cook often right it makes us depend on fast food and it makes it makes us feel too lazy to cook at home and we can readily we can become more dependent on it and when just imagine if there is no fast food restaurant in the world can we die right so fast we're really fat","Okay, so today I wanna talk about fast food. You know, of course, fast food is kinda harmful to our health for a few reasons. First off, it can make you gain weight because it usually has, like, a lot of sugar and it can be super salty, which isn't good for us. For example, my sister really liked KFC, and after just a week, she gained about two kilograms. So, she had to cut back on it.

Secondly, fast food definitely lacks nutrition. I mean, most fast food has a lot of meat, like sausages, but you don’t really see any vegetables or fresh stuff, like fresh milk or veggies, at those places. So, we’re missing out on a lot of nutrients. You can’t really have a balanced diet if you eat fast food all the time. If we stick to fast food for too long, we could end up with a bunch of health issues, like obesity or even heart attacks. When we munch on fast food, our blood pressure can go up, and that's just not something we wanna deal with.

And, you know, it's hard to deny how tasty fast food is. Like, it’s so tempting that we just can’t stop eating it. But after a while, all that fast food can definitely make us gain weight, and obesity is a real issue. To be more serious, we could face some heart problems down the line, and heart attacks are super dangerous.

Last but not least, fast food makes us kinda dependent, you know? When we go to a fast food place, it usually means we’re not cooking at home very often. So, we get lazy to cook, and that just makes us rely on fast food even more. Just imagine if there were no fast food restaurants in the world—could we even survive, right?

audio/HUST6923V6BY167/HUST0609230057-2.ogg," My situation is a group of foreign students studying Vietnamese history. You are asked to suggest the source of learning, three options are suggested, going to the museum, watching documentary, or reading history book. Personally, I think going to the museum is the best choice to a foreign student who can learn Vietnamese history more easier because it's practical and you can see all the history story with that in eye, in face to face and you can learn about the story, you can see how it's being done and how it's effect the, how it's preserved and you can see very clearly how it could bring you, you can learn the best the way through it. The reason I don't choose watching documentary or reading history book because when you're watching documentary, it takes time to finish the whole documentary and you cannot choose what you want to hear or what you want to learn about the documentary. You have to follow the video or the document and you have to wait till it ends so you can interact or ask questions or to find the answer you want and it's not easy to foreign students who don't know much about Vietnamese history to study through documentary. And lastly, I don't think reading history book is the best way for a foreign student studying Vietnamese history because a lot of information is written in Vietnamese and the Vietnamese word is not easy to translate into the English and some words could hard to understand for the foreign students and they could not understand the context of the event that happened in the past through the reading history book. Therefore, I think the best way for a foreign student to study Vietnamese history is to go into the museum where they could see the whole picture of the context of the event that happened in the past so they could learn it better. The next chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter. The second chapter is the second chapter.","Okay, so my situation is like a group of foreign students who are studying Vietnamese history, right? And you asked me to suggest some sources for learning. So, I’ve got three options here: going to the museum, watching a documentary, or reading a history book. Personally, I think going to the museum is the best choice for foreign students. Like, they can learn about Vietnamese history in a more hands-on way, you know? It’s practical because you get to see all the historical stuff up close, in person. You can really learn about the stories, see how things were done, and understand how it's all preserved. It's just a way better experience, in my opinion.

Now, the reason I don't pick watching documentaries or reading history books is that, like, with documentaries, it takes a lot of time to finish the whole thing. You can't really choose what you want to learn or hear about; you have to just go with the flow of the video, and that can be kind of hard for foreign students who might not know much about Vietnamese history. You can't really interact or ask questions while it's playing, so that makes it tough.

And then there's reading history books. I don't think that's the best either, honestly. A lot of the stuff is in Vietnamese, and translating it into English can be tricky. Some words are just hard to understand for foreign students, and they could totally miss the context of what happened in the past when reading. 

So, yeah, I really believe the best way for foreign students to study Vietnamese history is to go to the museum. They get to see the bigger picture of all these events from the past, and I think that's way more effective for learning. And, um, about the next chapter, I... wait, hold on, I think I kinda repeated myself there. Sorry about that!

audio/HUST305239KVN166/HUST3005230028-3.ogg," So I'm going to talk about the topic of narrative effects of offering freedom to the employees. So there are several ideas here that employees should not give them the freedom because first of all, the most important thing is to increase the average. So if you are an employer and your employees do not listen, your employees don't listen to you. So there will be conflict between you and the boss and the employees. So that may lead to bad situation when it comes to the jobs or something. So secondly, things are... I suppose they may cause more conflicts because if the employee has their freedom, they will not have any motivation to do anything else or just want to enjoy the free time. So they wouldn't be allowed to listen to us or hear anything from us anymore. And as a consequence of having so much fun, they can not get along with their deadlines on terms. They can't catch up with it on terms and so that the deadlines and the work is getting really really bad. So one another, one another bad effect tips to the companies and the employer is to call the employees if they have the freedom, they will not follow the rules and they won't think if they are an employee or they are an employer. So they can not like definite their meaning of the freedom or just simple that no one can tell them what to do and no one can order them to like offer them to finish the job. So that's this rumour to slow down the job in your company and so you may not like finish all the projects to your customers and the company will be brain dropped in any way. So however, we still have to talk about the advantage of offering it. So I don't think it's all bad phase of offering them their freedom, we just need to keep them in time and on time in the right place. So that they can not get through it too far and they can relax their brains or improve the work efficiently. So one of the most successful ways to motivate the employees is to hire their salary up and to give them the holiday trip with their family is the best way.","Okay, so I'm gonna talk about the narrative effects of offering freedom to employees. So, there are a few ideas here, and I think we shouldn't just give employees too much freedom. First of all, the most important thing is that it can actually affect productivity, right? Like, if you’re an employer and your employees don’t listen to you, then there’s gonna be some conflict between you and them, which can lead to a really bad situation when it comes to work and stuff.

Secondly, giving them too much freedom might cause even more conflicts, 'cause if employees feel too free, they might lack motivation to get anything done, you know? They might just wanna enjoy their free time instead of listening to guidance from us. As a result of having too much fun, they could miss deadlines and not keep up with their work. It could get pretty chaotic, honestly.

Another bad effect for companies is that, if they have too much freedom, employees might not follow the rules. They could forget their role as employees and think they don't have to listen to anyone. It might make them feel like nobody can tell them what to do, which can lead to a slowdown in productivity. This could mean not finishing projects on time, and the company could really suffer from that.

But, you know, we still need to talk about the advantages of offering some freedom. I don't think it’s all bad to give them a bit of freedom. We just need to make sure they stay on track and in the right place. That way, they can relax their minds a little and work more efficiently. I think one of the best ways to motivate employees is to increase their salary and maybe offer a holiday trip with their families.

In my opinion the best choice will be staying with his grandparents in the countryside because firstly my countryside has a very good condition of air and water and landscape so he can spend the summer to refresh his head after a long time living in the noisy and toxic city. The second is my his grandparents is very kind people they very take care about his health and about his food so staying with his parents will be the best choice for increasing his weight and his health. Another point is my his country has a small river and a small mouth so in the summer when he feelings in the summer he can choose going to swim in the river to learn how to swim and to learn how to swim that will be the great lesson on the summer because of swimming is the must have ability was to everyone and for the mountain he can go to that for a sightseeing and reading a new fresh air. I don't think a summer camp or summer school is the which I because he need my nephew needs to realize after his schooling on the last nine months another camp or another school will be very bad for his thinking and vision because he don't feel he don't feel relaxed summer that's he must have so inclusion I will send my nephew to his grandparents in the countryside","Okay, so, like, my family’s been talking about where my nephew, who's in seventh grade, should spend his summer holiday. I’ve got three options for him: there’s a summer camp, summer school, or staying with his grandparents in the countryside. 

In my opinion, the best choice is definitely staying with his grandparents in the countryside. First of all, the air and water out there are really great, and the scenery's beautiful, you know? It’ll be a nice way for him to refresh his mind after living in the loud and, like, toxic city for so long. 

Also, his grandparents are super kind people. They really take care of him, making sure he eats well and stays healthy. So I think staying with them would really help him gain some weight and just be healthier overall. 

Another thing is, there's a small river nearby, right? And during the summer, he can learn how to swim there, which is such an important skill to have. Plus, he can also go hiking in the mountains for some sightseeing and to enjoy that fresh air, you know? 

I really don’t think a summer camp or summer school would work for him because he needs to unwind after nine months of school. Going to another camp or school would just be too much, and he wouldn’t feel relaxed.

audio/HUST1411223Y1C167/HUST1411220040-1.ogg," There are so many environmental problems in my area. I can see waste all over the place, and because of these wastes, I have seen that when there is typhoon or hurricane, too much flooding can happen. I think the government should do something about creating more drainage and making sure that they study this before even creating the buildings. I thought that business people who are just building high-rise apartments or houses, they should survey the area to make sure that they can prevent these problems from occurring in the long run, because the population has increased a lot nowadays, and because of that, it can cause a lot of problems to the residents and the country. And I really believe that with environmental problems, the key for this prevention is with us humans. We need to become better citizens of this world. We need to make sure that we understand the problem, and we are not part of the problem. Instead, we can be part of the solution. Other ways that we can also prevent environmental problems is to organize clean-up drives. I know that I'm going to be a part of that clean-up drive, and this is my way or one way that we can help communities and we can build stronger communities by, like I said earlier, becoming part of the solution and not part of the problem. Instead of pinpointing to who is causing it, we can actually do one thing that can help our surroundings, that can help the environment, and to make sure that these problems, they don't continue to occur, but at least they can be prevented. Another reason is that people can start thinking about their waste management and also segregating degradable and biodegradable. That is not only helpful to the environment, but it also helps people who are segregating these wastes, and then there will be proper waste management. Again, this is all possible, and this can all be possible if everyone can be a part of the solution and are committed to making our surroundings and environment become a better place to live.","Okay, so, there are actually a lot of environmental problems in my area. Like, I see waste just everywhere, you know? And I’ve noticed that when there’s a typhoon or a hurricane, it leads to a ton of flooding, which is really bad. I think the government, like, really needs to do something about this, like, maybe create more drainage systems and make sure they study the area before they even start building new buildings.

I feel like businesspeople who are, you know, just building high-rise apartments or houses, they should definitely survey the area. I mean, they need to prevent these issues from happening in the long run. The population has really shot up recently, and that's causing a lot of stress for residents and the country overall.

And honestly, I believe that when it comes to environmental problems, the solution is really up to us humans. Like, we gotta become better citizens of the world. We need to understand the problems and, you know, not be part of the problem ourselves. Instead, we can be part of the solution. 

One way we can prevent these environmental issues is to organize clean-up drives. I know I’m gonna get involved in that. It's like one of the ways we can help our communities and build them up stronger, you know? Like I said, we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Instead of just pointing fingers at who’s causing the mess, we can actually take actions to help our environment and make sure these problems don’t keep popping up.

Another thing is people can start thinking about their waste management, like, really focusing on segregating their waste into degradable and non-degradable. This not only helps the environment, but it also makes things easier for people who are managing the waste. We can totally make this happen if everyone decides to chip in and be part of the solution. If we all commit to it, we can really improve our surroundings and make the environment a way better place to live.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C167/HUST1411220040-1.mp3,CD3,1

I used to study in the mathematics class back in my high school and I studied in the math class for like 7 years. Mathematics is a very popular subject in my country. It is considered to be a measurement for how smart you are. I do get on well with my classmates, not just in the studying side but also the social side. I play with them and we usually frequently have talks and whenever comes to a hard problem that is hard to resolve, we will brainstorm and give each other help and together we find the final answer. Let's talk about time. I don't think I'm so good at managing my time. I still find it quite unbalanced to balance the time of playing and relaxing and the time of studying and doing work. Usually I manage my time using a timetable and a list of the, I call that a list to do work, to do list, to do list that will lie out the work that I need to do in the next week or in the future time. But mostly for this is in the next week. Important stuff I will note it maybe the next month. I think that it's very important to manage your time so that you don't waste your time in just one thing and forget the others. Like you have to balance your time between spending time with friends, family, with your work and most importantly with yourself. I think it's most important to manage my time is when I come to study and revise things for my examinations.","Hey there! So, let’s talk about studying, alright? My favorite subject in school has gotta be math. I mean, I used to be in math class all through high school, like for seven years or so. Math is super popular in my country because people really see it as a way to measure how smart you are, you know? 

I really get along well with my classmates, not just when it comes to studying but also socially. We hang out, we play together, and we talk a lot. And whenever there’s a tough problem that we’re struggling with, we’ll brainstorm together and help each other out. I love how we can come together to figure things out until we find the final answer.

Now, about time management, I gotta say, I'm not the best at it. I still find it kinda tricky to balance my time between playing and relaxing versus studying and getting my work done. Usually, I try to use a timetable and I make this list, you know, a to-do list, that lays out what I need to do in the next week or so. But honestly, I mostly focus on just getting through the next week, and anything important for the next month, I’ll jot it down too.

I think managing your time is super important so you don’t waste it on just one thing and forget about everything else. You really gotta balance time with friends, family, your work, and, of course, time for yourself. To me, it's especially important to manage my time when I’m studying and revising for exams.

So, one of the cyber problem is the threat to privacy and personal information. There are many reasons for that. Spam, personal hacking, computer viruses. But the most serious problem is that people on the internet, they unintentionally publish their personal information in their posts, in the entries. And that's why a lot of personal information is leaked and stored on the internet for negative purposes. Now, we have some follow up question. Do you agree that your home is no longer a safe place to live? No, I don't agree because my home is still a safe place to live as long as I know how to protect my identity, I know how to protect my personal information. And the public security system is still working effectively in my country. So, my home is still a safe place to live. What should you do to stay away from online threats? As I mentioned, it's all about the personal information. So, if I want to stay away, I want to stay away from online threats. The only, the absolute method is to stay away from the internet. But if you still want to join the internet, to enjoy it and have social interaction on the internet without compromising your information, you should be really careful with this. And only provide the information with trusted companies and refrain yourself from publicly talking about your identities. What should the government do to help protect their privacy from online threats? You know, government is one party that is sucking the information from us. A lot of hackers are working for the government. So, the first thing they can do and they must do is stop interfering in our life and stop hacking. Stop trying to get our personal information. Stop monitoring it. Stop watching us. And the second thing is that they should pass, ignite and implement laws that stop hackers from stealing our information. We have a lot of hackers and we have a lot of threats from developing countries like China which is willing to steal everything from the world. The great copy of the world. And you know, we have a test called V-Steps. The tests have mistakes and I encountered several of them. So, I want an immediate refund. That's all. I'm gonna sing a song.","Alright, so, you know, there are a lot of problems on the internet, and we kinda call this like cyber security problems, right? It's all about cyber crime and stuff. One major issue is the threat to privacy and personal info. There are a bunch of reasons for this, like spam, personal hacking, and even computer viruses. But honestly, I think the worst part is that people, they sometimes just post their personal info without realizing it. So, that leads to a lot of personal details getting leaked and stored online for some not-so-great reasons.

Now, about this follow-up question: do I agree that my home isn't a safe place to live anymore? Nah, I don’t agree with that. My home is still a safe place for me as long as I know how to protect my identity and how to keep my personal info safe. Plus, the public security system in my country is still working well, so, yeah, I feel pretty secure at home.

Okay, what do you do to stay away from online threats? Like I said, it really comes down to personal information, right? If I want to avoid those online threats, the most sure-fire way is just to stay off the internet completely. But, you know, if you want to stay online and enjoy social interactions without risking your info, you gotta be super careful. Only share your personal data with trusted companies and avoid talking about your identity openly, like, ever.

And what about the government? What should they do to help protect our privacy from online threats? You know, the government is one group that collects our info, and there are hackers that act on behalf of the government, so it's a bit tricky. First off, they need to stop interfering in our lives, and they really should stop hacking and collecting our personal details. Like, just stop watching us, you know? 

Secondly, they should seriously pass and enforce laws that prevent hackers from stealing our information. There are loads of hackers out there, especially from countries like China, who are all about stealing stuff. 

Oh! And about this test I took called V-Steps? There were a bunch of mistakes, and I ran into several issues with it, so I want an immediate refund for that, please.

I write about my day-to-day life, like my hobbies, my work environment, or my friends.

Like, one option is visiting our old school and seeing teachers, another is throwing a party and inviting our classmates and teachers, and the last one’s about doing a one-day trip. 

Honestly, I think throwing a party and inviting everyone is the best choice for a bunch of reasons. First off, during a party, we’ll have plenty of time to catch up and just enjoy talking about everything. Plus, we can also do a lot of fun activities together, like dancing, playing games, you know, like quiz competitions or tug-of-war, or maybe even singing together. And, what's great is we'll get to have a meal together too, so we can really make some unforgettable memories.

Now, let me explain why I’m not really into the other two options, like visiting the old school and teachers or planning a one-day trip. For me, visiting the old school and teachers just isn’t super convenient. Not everyone will be able to find the time to go back, because everyone’s got their own jobs and stuff going on.

The reason for my suggestion is that at their grandparents' house, they have a pool in which our nephew can swim, and I think it's good for his body, his health. Secondly, in summer, all of our relatives and kids will concentrate or gather in the grandparents' house, so there are a lot of relatives and he can play with them. He can say hello, make friends, apply together, and I think it's good for his social strength. And finally, the last reason is that staying with his grandparents will help improve the generation's relationship between the older generation and the younger generation. And you know, in the modern life, there is a huge distance between the older generation and the younger generation, so staying with his parents will improve the relationship between them. And about the choice of joining a summer camp, I think it's quite a good choice, but when he joins in the summer camp, he can face some dangerous situations like falling in the spring or falling from a high cliff. Because we will not be there, so we cannot take care of him. And about the choice of taking a summer school, I think summer is a time for him to relax, so we should not take him to school and let him rest at the grandparents' house.","Okay, so when I think about our seventh great-nephew and how he should spend his summer holiday, I really think he should stay with his grandparents out in the countryside. I mean, there are a few reasons for that. First off, at his grandparents' house, they’ve got a pool, and he can swim there. It's, you know, really good for his body and health, right?

Then, in the summer, all of our relatives and kids usually come together at their place. So, that means he’ll have a bunch of cousins and family around to play with. He can, like, say hi to everyone, make some friends, and just have fun playing together. I think that’s really good for his social skills too, you know?

And the last thing is that staying with his grandparents will help strengthen the bond between the older and younger generations. These days, there’s kind of a gap, you know, between what the older folks think and how the younger ones feel. So, spending time with his grandparents can really help bring them closer together.

Now, about the idea of joining a summer camp, I mean, it sounds like a fun option too, but I worry a bit. He could end up in some dangerous situations, like, you know, falling into a spring or off a high cliff. And since we wouldn’t be around, we can’t really take care of him then.

And regarding summer school, I really think summer should be a time for him to chill out a bit. So, it’s probably best if we let him just relax and hang out at his grandparents’ instead of making him go to school.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_2/audio/HUST6723KTLX167/HUST0607230140-2.mp3,CD11_2,2

It's a great way to have the teenager can do the straight from learning all the subjects in school. They help them improve their concentration in try and focus to play the musical instrument step by step. Otherwise, they can learn half the time better besides... I think music should be a part of school's problem. Because the children have the teenager learn a new skill and it's very helpful for them in the real world. They can create a new creative hobby that have real strength and personal development. Right now in our country, the biggest popular is pop music and rap and hip hop music. I think we try to keep the Chinese for music and try to protect the Chinese music. We have cultural weakness and we have history shock of charm to them. So we still have the older generation to protect it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","Okay, so I think learning to play a musical instrument is really, like, a fantastic way to learn, you know? It’s a great way for teenagers to take a break from all the subjects they have to study in school, right? I mean, it helps them improve their concentration and really focus on playing that instrument step by step. Otherwise, they can learn, like, in half the time better or something like that. 

Also, I really believe music should be part of school programs, you know? Because it helps teenagers learn a new skill and that can be super helpful for them in the real world. They can develop this creative hobby that gives them real strengths and helps with personal growth. 

Right now, in our country, pop music, rap, and hip hop are, like, the most popular genres. But I think we should also try to keep our traditional music alive and protect it, you know? We've got cultural richness and a historical background that really matters. So, it's important that the older generation helps preserve that.

My favorite means of transportation is to use my motorbike when I go to work. It is efficient, it's quick, it is easy to drive and it makes the commute easier. One of the issues I face is traveling through the traffic. And often having issues with flat tire or running out of gas.

It is also very cost effective as the price is not that expensive and the Grab driver also understands English most of the time.

I prefer using electronic maps because it's way more it's easier to use paper maps they can be lost they can be destroyed or they can get wet but the electronic maps you just need a device and connections thus with electronic maps you can just type in the destinations and it will automatically show up. I have asked for directions instead of using maps of course sometimes it's way easier to ask locals about the destinations because sometimes the maps are not detailed enough to show everything and I was finding that this restaurant in a different city it was a relatively small one not really popular it was a Japanese restaurant I read the review online and I decided to give it a try this Japanese bistro it's really small and it's in an alley so not easy to find at all I tried to google it and nothing showed up I tried finding it on Facebook and nothing showed up either so all I can do all I can think of is to go to that location nearby and and ask the locals about it the locals not everyone knows what it is because well it's not so popular I've been going around for an hour around that street and then I finally found it it was small a tiny restaurant deep in an alley and it took me such an effort to find and I was completely starved when I arrived so I guess it was a arduous experience but because I was hungry the food was relatively good and I also love Japanese cuisine so I guess it was worth it,"Okay, so, I've definitely used maps before, but I gotta say, I really prefer electronic maps. I mean, they’re just way easier to use, you know? Like, with paper maps, they can get lost or damaged or even soaked if it rains. But with electronic maps, all you need is a device and a connection, right? You just type in where you wanna go, and boom, it shows you the route.

Sometimes, though, I’ve asked for directions instead of relying on maps. I mean, there are times when it's just way easier to ask locals about where to go, 'cause honestly, the maps can be super vague and don’t always have all the details you need. Like, there was this one time I was looking for this Japanese restaurant in a different city. It wasn't very popular, just a small place I read about online, and I thought, “Okay, I have to try this out."" 

But man, this bistro was really tricky to find. It was tucked away in an alley, so definitely not easy to spot. I googled it, and nothing came up. I even searched for it on Facebook, but no luck there either. So, all I could think was, ""Okay, I just need to go to the area and ask some locals."" 

The thing is, not everyone knew about it since it wasn’t well-known. I ended up wandering around for like an hour on that street, but finally, I found it! It was this tiny restaurant, deep in the alley, and I was so relieved to discover it after all my searching. Honestly, by the time I got there, I was starving. So, yeah, it turned out to be kind of a tough experience, but hey, the food was pretty good! And I just love Japanese cuisine, so overall, I guess it was worth the effort.",9.5,9.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230055-1.mp3,CD9_1,1

And so I heard that you are planning and you're in a quandary between Hanoi, Sapa and Darat. And, well, I think that the city that you should visit is Hanoi. Why? Because the first and foremost reason is that I am living in Hanoi right now. So I would be really good at showing you all the buildings, showing you all the streets, signs and all of the special things that I have known about Hanoi in my course of living there. And also it is a city of culture. Yeah, it's a city of culture because it is the capital. So there it's a lot of very important buildings there. So yeah, it's a very beautiful place. And also it is a city of culture. Why? Because the city of Hanoi is pretty old. It has been there since, I think, one thousand and ten. Yeah, maybe. And it has a lot of cultural values that I find it very interesting every time I wanted to talk about it or showing it to my friends and cousins and stuff. And yeah, that's why I and the food are awesome, too. The cuisine is just awesome. Vietnamese cuisine are awesome. Yeah, overall. And especially that because I live in Hanoi, I can show you all the signs. I can show you everything that I know about a special place. So that's why I decided to give you Hanoi as the best destination that you should be planning to visit during the summer vacation. What about Sabah and Dalat? I think that Sabah is a great place, but only for a short period of time that you're staying there. And why? Because the city is very cold. Yeah, it's kind of cool in the summer, though. But yeah, well, annually it's very cold, like throughout a year. And I don't think that Sabah is a very good place for you to stay for a long time, especially if you are planning to visit a whole city in the country for your summer vacation. And Dalat is a very interesting place. And I really like to travel there, but I have only traveled there once. And I know that you're probably going to go with one of your tourist guide or some guidance. You're going to have some go on a tour or something, or maybe just planning to visit there to have a joyful, wonderful summer. Well, but I don't recommend Sabah and Dalat very much. Well, go to Hanoi. Thank you.","Hey! So, I heard you’re planning to visit a city in Vietnam for your summer vacation, right? And you’re kinda stuck deciding between Hanoi, Sapa, and Dalat. Well, I really think you should go with Hanoi. Why? Well, for starters, I actually live in Hanoi right now, so I could totally show you around all the cool spots—like the buildings and the street signs, and just all the special things I've picked up living here.

And, you know, Hanoi is a city filled with culture. Since it’s the capital, there are lots of important buildings and it's just a really beautiful place. Plus, it's pretty old—like, it’s been around since, I think, 1010 AD or something like that? It has so much cultural value, and I always find it interesting to share that with my friends and family. 

And let’s not forget about the food—Vietnamese cuisine is absolutely amazing! So, since I live here, I can show you all the best places to eat and just share everything I know about this special city. That’s why I think Hanoi would be the best choice for your summer plans.

Now, about Sapa and Dalat. Sapa is nice, but I think it might be better for just a short visit. It can be pretty cold there, especially in the summer, and I don’t know if it’s the best spot for a longer stay if you wanna explore the whole country.

As for Dalat, it’s a really interesting place, and I liked it when I visited—just been there once though. But I know you’ll probably be going with a tour guide or something like that, and while it’s cool for a short trip, I still think you’d enjoy Hanoi a lot more for your summer vacation.

It is a summer camp, taking a summer school or staying with his grandparents in the country. For me, I would not choose to join a summer camp because it is going to happen in the short time and I think that it cannot be long enough for him to improve his skills or make some friends like this. I also disagree with staying with his grandparents in the country because I know that he did not live in the country. He lived in a big city with all of the entertainment and services. And actually taking a summer school because in summer school the teachers will teach him the social skills, the subjects, a lot of games which can stimulate his intelligence. I think it is going to increase his critical thinking in a lot of matters in our life instead of staying at home with grandparents. And Mr. Abad, I know in the summer school he also organized a lot of games as well as the parties for the extra curriculars. And I think for this kind of subject, I mean kind of activities will help him so much. It will also be a memorable memory for him because he has not stayed with his family since he was born. So I think it will be the best memories for him. And as well he can make some more friends and improve his skills.

So, like, there's summer camp, summer school, or he could stay with his grandparents in the country. But for me, I wouldn't pick summer camp 'cause it’s just a short time, you know? I don’t think that’s long enough for him to really improve his skills or make good friends.

And then there’s the idea of staying with his grandparents. I mean, he doesn’t live in the country; he’s used to a big city with all those entertainment options and services. So, I think he’d feel kinda out of place there. 

Now, summer school, I think that’s the best option. In summer school, the teachers can help him learn social skills and, like, all the different subjects. Plus, there are games that can really get his brain working, you know? I think this’ll definitely boost his critical thinking about a lot of things in life instead of just hanging out at home with his grandparents.

And, oh, Mr. Abad, I heard summer school also has a bunch of games and parties for extracurricular activities. I mean, those kinds of activities really help a kid out. It’ll be super memorable for him since he hasn’t really spent a lot of time with family since he was born, right? 

So, yeah, I think it’ll become some of his best memories, and he’ll make more friends and totally improve his skills.

First of all, first and foremost, hotel is really easy to find. You can find it all the way to your trip, like it's right on the street and it is usually, often, it's really big and this kind of accommodation is really easy to find, even through many apps on the smartphone. Also, in hotel, the services here is really good. You will have the waitress bringing all the services like things and everything you need to deal with your trip or to deal with something emergency and more or I think that hotel is the best choice because most of the time or in every famous location or well known location like Danden city, we can easily find that city always have the best view which can help the tourists to go to the beach easier or just going to the center easier. If I have to reconsider about the homestay and self catering flat, it is kind of hard for me to stay there because first of all, it is really hard to find. Not all the homestays or self catering flats are easy to find through apps or through just wandering around the city to look at it and especially the services here is mostly about you because there will not be waitress or anyone who will help you in emergency moments so I still would rather to stay in hotel than to go to the hotel because not only the best view as well as easy to reach to the center but also can enjoy my trip as well as my moments with my family and friends especially a group of students they should stay in hotel because where they are not really familiar with the city therefore they can reach to the center easier.","Okay, so if I had to recommend a place for a group of foreign students planning a trip to Danden, like, if I had to choose between three types of accommodations—hotel, homestay, and self-catering flat—I would definitely pick a hotel for a few reasons. 

First of all, hotels are super easy to find. You can spot them all over the place during your trip, like, they're right there on the street. Usually, they're pretty big, and you can easily book one through lots of apps on your smartphone, which makes it a breeze. 

Also, the services in hotels are really good, you know? You’ve got waitstaff who can help you with everything you need, whether it’s during your trip or if there’s some sort of emergency. Plus, I think hotels are the best option because in well-known places like Danden city, you can often find hotels that have great views. This can help tourists get to the beach or into the city center much easier.

Now, when I think about homestays and self-catering flats, it feels a bit tougher to stay there. For starters, they can be hard to find. Not all of them show up easily on apps, or sometimes it's just tricky if you're wandering around looking for them. And with homestays or flats, you kinda have to rely on yourself because there aren’t usually any waitstaff around to help during emergencies.

So, I’d really prefer staying in a hotel over the other options, mainly because you get that great view, easy access to the city center, and you can enjoy your trip a lot more with family and friends. Especially for a group of students who might not be familiar with the city, staying in a hotel just makes it way easier for them to get around.",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC167/HUST3110230152-2.mp3,CD16_2,2

I can do the calculation, I can do the analytical thinking, which is what I like to do. I don't really like other subjects that are not using your mind, such as literature or geography. That's just boring. The subject is, I'm guessing, kind of popular, or should I say notorious. The notorious subject in my country seems not a lot of people can start it. Students from high school, they are struggling with it. They said it is hard to solve the problem. The chemistry goals are just horrible things. It is not quite friendly for them to study. And so it is hated. I mean, for like, about 70% of our students. So that is chemistry. And do I get unwell with my classmates? To put it in this way, I get unwell with everyone in my classmates, but I'm not close to anyone. It is kind of my thing, you know. I always try to be socialized with everyone, so I can be friendly with them, I can ask them for many things. You know, just being a friendly friend. But I don't tend to get close to anyone since I have a problem with the trusting issue. It happens when I was a child, so I don't get to trust people that much. And it gets me hard to just be acquainted with someone, not to mention get close to one. From all my years studying from primary school to university, I only have like 10 close friends. And I get a life of 300 friends total. And only 10 of them is my best friend. But for the general thing, I will try to get along with everyone.","Okay, so let me tell you about my favorite subjects. I think I’d have to say chemistry, ‘cause, you know, with chemistry, I can do a lot of stuff. I can do calculations, and I really like analytical thinking, which is cool for me.

Chemistry is kinda popular, or maybe I should say notorious? Like, a lot of students in my country really struggle with it. High school kids say it’s hard to solve the problems, and, honestly, the chemistry goals can feel really tough. It doesn't seem very friendly for them, which is why it’s kinda hated—like, about 70% of students have a hard time with it. 

Now, about my classmates—do I get along with them? Well, I get along with everyone, but I’m not super close to anyone. That’s just how I am, you know? I try to be social and friendly with everyone, ask them questions, things like that. But, I don’t usually get too close to anyone ‘cause I have some trust issues from when I was a kid. So, it’s hard for me to really get to know someone, let alone get close to them. 

Throughout my school years, from primary to university, I’ve only had, like, 10 close friends out of about 300 friends in total. So, I guess you could say only 10 of them are my best friends.

To do the project well, I would actually go to the countryside because then I get to experience everything for real. The smells, what I see, what is happening there. The internet might not tell me how a countryside smells, whether the rain, the earth. Books could be interesting, I guess, and describe things well, but actually being there in person, the sensory feelings, using all your senses, sight, touch, smell, and what you can hear in the countryside. So I would do that. And also, when you're in the countryside, you can actually walk around and talk to the people who are there, see what's happening there, the animals, look at the different houses. You can actually go around talking to people. When you're in the countryside, talk to people, to ask them what it's like. So it's a different perspective that a book or the internet would not provide. So I would go to the countryside, the actual countryside, to do a project on the countryside because I can find out more about what happens in the countryside using all your senses.

The first and foremost, the obvious benefit is that it can make them more independent. As they can develop their own learning strategy, they have to make decisions for themselves and therefore it can increase their feeling of independence as a preparation for their growing up life. Secondly, self-study skills help improve their time management. Since there are technical gadgets, they can study at any time and anywhere at any location with anyone. They are free from managing their timetable. Therefore, this may benefit them for their future job which may require this kind of skill. Thirdly, self-study skills can lead to better academic performance. Since they have decisions toward their learning progress, they may feel more excited and more like endorsement toward their learning, resulting in better learning results. Finally, self-study skills can help them to enhance other soft skills, especially the computer skills. Self-study is supported mostly by technology like laptops or tablets. It may help them to know how to deal with those electronic devices. In conclusion, self-study can bring about many benefits to school students. School and parents should have some encouragement to school students to improve their self-study skills. Honestly, self-study skills are not considered important in my country since our national curriculum is more focused on traditional methods. I believe that self-study skills should be compulsory in school. As I have mentioned before, self-study skills are beneficial to school students and can be beneficial to their career and improve their career prospects. They are not trained carefully.","Okay, so, you know, I really believe that self-study is super beneficial for school students, and these days, they're really encouraged to build this skill. First off, I mean, the main benefit is that it helps make them more independent. When they develop their own learning strategies, they gotta make decisions for themselves, and that really boosts their feeling of independence, which is great for preparing for adult life, right? 

Then, another thing is that self-study skills really help with time management. I mean, with all the tech gadgets out there, students can study whenever and wherever they want—like at home, in a café, or even with friends. They get to manage their own schedules, which is a big plus for their future jobs that might need this kind of skill.

Also, self-study can totally lead to better grades. When students have a say in their learning, they're usually more excited and feel more motivated to learn. And this often results in better results. 

And don't forget about the soft skills! Self-study helps them enhance other skills, especially computer skills. Most self-study is done using tech like laptops or tablets, so they learn how to handle all those electronic devices.

So, in conclusion, self-study brings a ton of benefits for school students. I think schools and parents should really encourage them to get better at self-study. Honestly, in my country, self-study isn't seen as that important since our national curriculum leans more towards traditional methods. But I believe self-study should definitely be a must-have in schools.

One of the sources and one of the factors where people tend to be very sad is because of the expectation. First is the expectation. People tend to have a lot of expectations before doing anything they want and ended up failing or ended up having a failed result. So somehow because of the ego and pride of one person he cannot or she cannot accept that the expectation was failed. So that's one factor. Another factor is being not contented of what they have, comparing what they have to the other people, comparing what they don't have to their peers. So people tend to see the things that they don't have and for some reasons it makes them sad. Also some sources nowadays of being sad is technology. We have to face the reality that because of technology people nowadays got a random attitude, a random acceptance with everything that they see online. So one of the main reasons of being sad and one of the main sources of sadness nowadays is technology. Especially for teens, especially for kids. So they are thinking that everything they see online, everything they see in any platforms is the things that they will get easily and they are not realizing that all of those things are not difficult to get. So technology is one of the sources of sadness and somehow benefits of crying, the benefits of crying is you can give out all the emotions that you have, the rejections that you experience, the sadness and it can help you release your bad energy through crying. So overcoming stress could be sharing with someone else. I do believe that when you share all your heartaches, all your pain to other people can help you have good emotion. Listening to music can divert your mind and your heart especially if you are listening to a good genre of music. Doing exercise can also help you overcome sadness because you can see nature, you can have fresh air and you can see other people and you can see greens around you. I believe green can give you peace of mind. I also do believe that overcoming sadness you have to pray because praying is one of my biggest tools whenever I am sad. So just pray and reflect and meditate and realize.","Okay, so there are a lot of reasons why people feel sad, you know? Like, one big reason is expectations. People tend to have these high hopes for what they want to achieve, and when things don’t go as planned, they often end up feeling really let down. It’s tough for someone to accept that their expectations didn't work out, and that can lead to sadness, right? 

Another thing is not being content with what they have. You know, people often compare themselves to others and look at what they don’t have instead of appreciating what they do have. That kind of mindset can definitely make them feel sad.

And there’s also technology, which is like a huge factor these days. I mean, we have to face it, technology can really change how people feel. It seems like a lot of people, especially teens and kids, think that everything they see online is just, like, within reach, right? They don’t realize that getting those things isn't as easy as it looks, and that can make them feel inadequate or sad.

Now, crying can actually have its benefits too. It’s a way to let out all those emotions—like sadness or rejection. Crying can help release some of that bad energy you’ve been holding onto.

And, like, sharing your feelings with someone else can really help too. I truly believe that when you talk about your heartaches and pain with others, it can lighten the load, you know?

Another great way to deal with sadness is listening to music. Just finding a good song that matches your mood can really help you shift your perspective. And exercise is super helpful too. Getting outside, breathing in fresh air, and seeing nature—like, all the green around you—is a good way to clear your mind. I really think green can be calming.

And then there's praying. For me, prayer is, like, a major tool when I’m feeling down. So taking time to pray, reflect, and meditate can really help someone work through their sadness.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220022-3.mp3,CD3,3
audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220019-2.ogg," Interesting question, there is a question about how to deal with smoking in public places. That thing is quite popular in Vietnam. There are three suggestions. Finding smokers, I linked 500,000 VND. Asking smokers to do community service or sending smokers to prison. You know smokers when they smoke they discharge exalts and that is helpful to the environment and to the people standing next to them. So we need to make them compensate for the loss that they have caused. But I think 500,000 is not enough. To some people it is not really a big sum and they are willing to pay 500,000 for each time they smoke in public. So it is not going to be prohibiting enough asking smokers to do community service. This is the best choice because it has caused smokers, there are times they have to do something in conversation for what they have done to reimburse for the loss and they need to really go there to work and not just to spend, throw some money. Sending smokers to prison is too stringent. I think it is too strict because smoking is quite popular and just because someone is smoking means they are going to the prison is unfair. You know the more important thing is education and what we use to assess student ability is the test. In Vietnam we have a test that I am taking part in, we call it V-STAT, the national test for English. I found mistakes in the test. This is the second time that I have taken the test and there are always mistakes in the reading section. There was a question asking about the Brahma guide, a guide called Brahma and I couldn't find his name in the text. I don't know why they put the question, you know there may be some missing text, the text may be missing but it is not fair so I demand an immediate refund after you inspect the text. Hi there.","Okay, so that’s an interesting question about dealing with smoking in public places, which is actually pretty common in Vietnam. I’ve got three suggestions. First, we could fine smokers, like, give them a 500,000 VND fine. Second, we could ask smokers to do community service. And third, there’s the option of sending smokers to prison. 

You know, when smokers light up, they release smoke and that really affects the environment and the people around them. So, we need to make them pay for the harm that they cause. But honestly, I don’t think 500,000 VND is enough. For some people, that's not a big deal and they're willing to just pay it every time they smoke in public, which isn’t really gonna stop the behavior. 

Now, asking smokers to do community service might be the best option, I mean, it makes them actually do something to make up for what they’ve done. They can’t just pay their way out of it. They need to physically participate in helping the community or something like that. 

As for sending smokers to prison, I think that’s way too harsh. Smoking is super common, and penalizing someone with jail time just for smoking feels really unfair, you know? 

Now, moving on to education—something we really need to talk about when it comes to assessing student ability. In Vietnam, we have a test called V-STAT, which is a national English test that I’m actually taking part in. I’ve noticed some mistakes in this test. This is my second time taking it, and there are always errors, especially in the reading section. Like, there was this question about a guide named Brahma, but I couldn’t find his name in the reading text at all. I don’t get why they would use that question.

Welcome to Vietnam, U.N.! Especially during the summer vacation, you know. So, I’ve got three options to suggest for you: Hanoi, Sapa, or Dalat. But, in my opinion, Dalat might be the best choice for you to visit in the summer.

First of all, in Dalat, the weather is super nice! It’s cool and breezy, and honestly, it feels great. The weather there is much more pleasant compared to Hanoi, which can be really hot during summer. So, besides the lovely weather, the sightseeing and the food in Dalat are also pretty exceptional.

Let’s talk about the food. You can enjoy things like chicken soup or chicken hotpot, which are perfect dishes for that cool vibe. And about the sights, Dalat is really famous for its beautiful waterfalls and lakes. They’re so peaceful and pretty! I think it’s just a fantastic place for you to relax and recharge your batteries before heading back to work.

Plus, in Dalat, there are a ton of romantic spots, like cozy homestays and lovely lakes, which are perfect if you’re looking to spend time with your partner. 

Now, regarding Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam, it’s really famous for its culture and all, and I mean, the food there is delicious! But during the summer, the weather in Hanoi can be incredibly hot. It gets kinda annoying, you know? 

And then there’s Sapa, which is also a mountainous area in Vietnam. It has its charm, but I feel like the food and the romantic spots there don't quite match up to what you’d find in Dalat.

So, if you’re thinking about where to go in the summer, I really think Dalat is the way to go!",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_1/audio/HUST281123Q63S166/HUST2811230020-2.mp3,CD17_1,2
audio/HUST4423NA1U167/HUST0404230062-2.ogg," So I am in a situation that one of my cousins is bullied at school. Yeah, it is very sad to be here that but yeah, in the situation, I think I would come to his teacher to talk about this situation. I chose this solution because the bully situation is the job of school and the school has the responsibility to make sure that they provide the students a good environment to study. It is not the environment that the students are being bullied at school and it is not a good environment to study. And I think the teacher, they also have the best way to handle this situation. They have the experience to guide the students all the time and I think it is better to let them know and they can handle this situation better than if we directly interact with the students or with the bullyers. So why I do not choose to talk with his parents? Yeah, because I think the cousin is the son of his parents so maybe the parents will be overreacting this situation and it will make the situation maybe worse than it would be. The mother is like his son and maybe she can come to school and make some bad habits at school. I think this makes my cousins feel embarrassed at school because they are calling the help from the family and their friend will joke at him because of that. And yeah, I will not talk about his bullies, his bullyers because they have many bullyers in the world and it is not in the school. And after he graduated, he finished school and he also met the bullyers in daily life so he has to handle it by himself. And this is my solution when one of my cousins bullies at school. In my opinion, bullies are not good but it is necessary and we have to overcome it by ourselves.","Okay, so, I'm in a situation where one of my cousins, like, is getting bullied at school, and yeah, it's really sad to see that happening. So, I think I would talk to his teacher about it, you know? I chose this solution because dealing with bullying is really the school's job, and they have a responsibility to make sure students have a good environment to study in. I mean, it’s definitely not a good environment if students are being bullied at school.

And I really believe that teachers, they, like, know the best way to handle this kind of situation. They have the experience to guide students, and I think it’s better to let them know. They can deal with it better than if we, like, confronted the bullies ourselves. 

Now, you might wonder why I wouldn't just talk to his parents instead. Well, I think, you know, since my cousin is their son, they might overreact, and that could end up making things worse. Like, the mom might come to the school and create a scene, which could lead to my cousin feeling embarrassed, and then his friends might tease him about it. 

Also, I don't want to focus too much on the bullies themselves, because there are bullies everywhere, not just in school. After school, he’s still gonna encounter bullies in real life, so he needs to learn how to handle things himself too, you know? 

So yeah, that’s my solution for my cousin being bullied at school. I really think bullying is not good, but it’s something we’ve gotta learn to overcome ourselves in the end.",8.0,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U167/HUST0404230062-2.mp3,CD8_1,2

And if I do exercise, I tend to do it alone because I don't want, I don't feel like joining the clubs and doing exercise and be surrounded by, and being surrounded by other people.

My favorite speech is in Da Nang. I don't remember the exact names of the beach, but I go there maybe every two years, even five years when I have a chance to go on holidays. When I travel to the beach, when I spend my time on the beach, I tend to relax and sunbathe, lie in the sand, or play with the wave. I also help my children to build the sand castles. Da Nang is famous for many beautiful beaches, and it is considered as the must-live city in Vietnam. That's the reason why many tourists come to Da Nang to visit one of the most magnificent beaches in the world. If I have a chance and if I can afford, I would love to go to Da Nang at least once or twice a year. But now, due to my limited time and my busy job, my busy occupations, I do not have many opportunities to travel to beautiful beaches in my country. I would love to spend the money on visiting the local tourist attractions because I know that there are so many places in my country I haven't explored.

My favorite place to relax is Da Nang, and I can’t really remember the names of the beaches there, but I try to go maybe every two or five years whenever I get the chance for a holiday.

So I really do know how Like what she like to wear in special occasions And like a clothing is really easy to buy like you can buy it online Or if you have time you can go to like an office show store to buy and then you I keep my friends clothing of item I think I can see her wear it in many situations Actually when we give presents to people we would like them to wear it usually only We would like to see them in our present Like always so for the reason I'm not choosing a book or a pair of movie tickets I think I don't really know about my friends taste in book and I don't think a book is a really good choice because if she Finished reading she would just let it aside and not touching like if again With a movie ticket I think I could afford one but like I don't think my friends would like to go to a movie theater alone So either that I will have to buy two tickets And I'm not sure if she wants to watch movie and if she have free time on the day that I buy the tickets So I think I would definitely go with the clothing item. I think I'll get like her dress T-shirt for the clothing item that is the end of question 2 let's move to question 3 You You","Okay, so my best friend's birthday is coming up, and I gotta choose between a clothing item, a book, or movie tickets. For me, I’d definitely pick a clothing item for a few reasons. First of all, she's my best friend, so I really know what she likes to wear, especially for special occasions. Plus, buying clothes is pretty easy, you know? You can just snag something online, or if you have time, you can hit up a local store and check it out in person.

I mean, I really wanna see her wearing whatever I get her in different situations. When we give gifts, we kinda hope to see them using or wearing it, right? That’s why I’m leaning away from choosing a book or movie tickets. 

Like, with a book, I don’t really know her taste that well. I mean, what if she finishes it and then it just sits there collecting dust? And about the movie tickets—while I could buy one, I seriously doubt she’d wanna go to the movies by herself. If that’s the case, I’d have to get two tickets, and I’m not even sure if she’d be up for watching a movie when I want to go, you know?

audio/HUST241022SCRI167/HUST2410220039-2.ogg," I think if my friend called me or messaged me and asked me to come to Hanoi for the weekend, I think I would choose Hanoi Museum because it has a lot of historic artifacts and historic records, historic documents, historic things that you can look at, learn about, explore. Yeah, and I think there's so many memories there that young people, especially us now, didn't get to live through. So going to the museum shows you things from the past and how people used to live, what are some of the things they used to do, how they used to go about their lives in Hanoi. Yeah, and there are some documents and things that you can see from even the wall, like what happened way back when Vietnam was having their civil crisis. There are a lot of documentations, a lot of records, a lot of artifacts that you can go and see from that time, like what happened, who did what, some of the equipments that were left over from there, a lot of pictures of events that happened in the past. So you get to see all these things. And I think for me, it's quiet. There are people that go to the museum, but you won't find a lot of people like the way you might find them in other places when you go. So it's a controlled environment where you find people that are interested in history, going to learn, going to see amazing things that they didn't get to see when they were growing up. Maybe some of the things that parents use or experience can be found in museums. Some things that you might not find in history books. Yeah, you can go to the museum and find those things there. And I think there are a lot of pictures and records about Ho Chi Minh. So that's one way you could go and learn about him and how essential he was to Vietnam and Hanoi.","Okay, so if my friend were to call or message me and ask me to come to Hanoi for the weekend, I think I’d definitely pick the Hanoi Museum. It’s just packed with all these historic artifacts and records, you know, things that you can really look at and learn about. I mean, there’s so much history there that us young people today didn’t get to experience firsthand. So, when you go to the museum, it’s like stepping back in time and seeing how people lived back then, what their daily lives were like in Hanoi.

Yeah, and there are documents and stuff on the walls showing what went down during the civil crisis in Vietnam. It's really fascinating. You can see all kinds of records and artifacts from that time, like who did what, and some of the leftover equipment from back in the day, plus tons of pictures of events that shaped history. So, you really get a look at all these things.

For me, the museum’s pretty quiet, which I like. Yeah, there are people there, but it’s not overcrowded like you might find in other places. It’s more of a controlled environment where folks who are interested in history go to learn and check out amazing stuff they didn't see when they were growing up. Like, some of the things that our parents might have used or experienced can actually be found in museums, and you won’t always find that in history books, you know? 

Plus, there are a lot of pictures and records about Ho Chi Minh there, too, so that’s another way to learn about him and how important he was to Vietnam and Hanoi. It’s just a great place to dive into history.",9.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD2/audio/HUST241022SCRI167/HUST2410220039-2.mp3,CD2,2
audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230104-2.ogg," So actually, I think that when I have the responsibility to organize a field trip to learn about the Hanoi next week, the place that I recommend is the Swart Lake. The first thing, the first reason is you can immerse yourself in the fresh air around the Swart Lake in Hanoi. You can walk around and take a deep breath even in the winter or summer. Around the lake, the temperature will be warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. This is also surrounded by the walking street. In that way, you can meet many people, both Vietnamese and foreigners. You can walk and talk and enjoy many activities in the walking street. You can also meet many foreigners and communicate with foreigners from all around the world like the US, UK, Korea, Japan. You can also communicate with many people from all around the world, just around the lake. The reason I don't choose the Ho Chi Minh Museum or Hanoi Museum is Ho Chi Minh Museum, like many people come to that place, remind me that there are many rules and standards you have to follow. If you don't do that, maybe you will receive some punishment. About the Hanoi Muslims, it's just like a span for the scholars. People come to that place have some knowledge about the museum, about the art, about the efforts with that. The Ho Chi Minh Museum and Hanoi Museum is an academic place. It's just suitable for someone who is really serious. But if you want to feel free and comfortable, we can choose the sword lake.","Okay, so, I think when I'm, like, given the task to organize a field trip to learn about Hanoi next week, I’d totally recommend going to Sword Lake. So, the first thing is you can really enjoy the fresh air around the lake. It's nice, you know? You can walk around and take a deep breath, even if it’s winter or summer. The temperature near the lake feels warmer in winter and cooler in summer, which is great. 

Plus, it's surrounded by this walking street. So, you can meet a lot of people, both Vietnamese and foreigners, it's pretty cool. You can just walk and chat and enjoy different activities there. You'll run into folks from all over the world, like the US, UK, Korea, Japan—you name it! I mean, it’s a great spot for communication and meeting new people. 

Now, the reason I’m not choosing the Ho Chi Minh Museum or the Hanoi Museum is that, like, the Ho Chi Minh Museum can be a bit strict, right? There are a lot of rules you have to follow, and if you don't, it feels like you could get in trouble. And then there’s the Hanoi Museum, which kinda feels like a place just for scholars. It’s more about knowledge and art, and all that stuff. So, it's really serious, you know? 

But if you wanna feel relaxed and comfortable, then Sword Lake is definitely the way to go. It just has a much more laid-back vibe.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_1/audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230104-2.mp3,CD11_1,2
audio/HUST6923LKZ9167/HUST0609230585-3.ogg," When I was a child, I would tell my parents that self-study skills are really important. As a student, they should enhance their self-study skills because of the following reasons. First of all, self-study skills can help students manage their terms better. For example, if they have one assignment, if they have self-study skills, they can do everything by themselves. They can know exactly what time we need to do and which one we need to do first and which one we will do after. Self-study skills in this case will help students manage their time and finish everything on time. The second one is self-study skills is to have students be independent. They can do everything by themselves without asking too much teachers or asking too much of their friends. For sure, self-study skills also have to improve academic performance at school. For example, I am a university student. If I spend two hours per day for studying, compared to a student, they don't know what to do and they don't have self-study skills. They don't study and for sure, my academic performance at school will be higher. For me, I think that self-study skills need to be taught at school because for me, it should be compulsory because it has a lot of benefits that I mentioned above. Actually, in Vietnam, a self-study skill is not a subject in school but it can be taught via some subject that refers to the literature or something like that. Self-study skills also bring me a lot of benefits. I can earn money from self-study skills. If I have learned by myself a new skill, I can open my chain to get a good job with high salary. If a student likes the self-study skill, actually, it can affect a lot to their performance at university. For example, if the student cannot study or herself do their homework or do their assignment, this one can affect their attendance score or it can affect their assessment examination. If they don't study by themselves, they may not get a good point or get a good mark at the final test or final examination and they can be failed or they cannot get graduated.","Okay, so when I was a kid, I used to tell my parents how important self-study skills are, you know? Like, I really think that as students, it’s super important for them to improve those skills for a bunch of reasons. First off, self-study skills really help students manage their time better. Like, if they have an assignment, those skills make it easier for them to do things on their own. They can figure out when they need to do stuff, what to do first, and what can wait. So, having good self-study skills is all about time management and getting everything done on time.

Then there's like, the second reason — self-study skills help students become more independent. They can do everything by themselves without always bugging their teachers or friends for help. For sure, these skills can also boost their academic performance. Like, I'm a university student, and if I spend two hours every day studying, that's gotta help me more than a student who doesn’t know how to study on their own. Without those skills, they might struggle, and my grades would probably be better than theirs, right?

Honestly, I think self-study skills should be taught at school, like, they should be mandatory because they bring so many benefits that I just talked about. In Vietnam, though, it's not like a specific subject in school, but you can kinda learn it through other subjects, like literature and stuff. 

And you know, self-study skills have done a lot for me, too. I can actually make money from learning new skills by myself. If I pick up something new, I can totally get a good job with a nice salary. So, if students embrace self-study skills, it can really influence their performance at university. Like, if they can't figure out how to do their homework on their own, it could mess up their attendance or their exam scores. If they aren’t studying by themselves, they might not do well on tests or final exams, and that could lead to failing or not graduating.

I would say I would like to live in a house because more space. Sometimes a house can have a little garden area, so just being outside of the house will help you mentally as well instead of just being surrounded by four walls. And what are the advantages and disadvantages of living in a flat and a house? Well, like I said, living in a house you have more space, usually a garden, so taking care of the garden is an activity you can do to stay active. Living in a flat is smaller, not a lot to do, so you probably will stare at your screen the whole time. So those are some advantages and disadvantages of living in a house and a flat. Another advantage of living in a flat is it's small, so you don't have to clean as often. A disadvantage of living in a house is it's bigger, so you have more to clean, so give and take there. But for me, I prefer to live in a house. Can you describe your dream house? Definitely needs to be near the coast where I can smell the ocean. A lot of windows for natural light. A lot of open space. Beautiful kitchen with a granite countertop with an island in the middle of the kitchen. Spacious bedrooms. Just a modern design. That would be the dream house if I could build it. That would be nice if I could build my own house. Let's talk about holiday destinations. What is your favorite holiday destination? Definitely the coast. I love the sand, I love the beach, the water. If I think of holidays, I immediately think family, friends on the beach with an ice cream. Question. What do you prefer, going on holiday overseas or in your own country? This is a difficult question. I love to travel, so overseas is my preferred way of going on holiday to experience new cultures, new landscapes, new countries.","Alright, so let’s dive into the topic of accommodation. Would I prefer to live in a flat or a house? I gotta say, I’d pick a house for sure. I mean, there’s just more space, right? Plus, sometimes a house comes with a little garden, and just being outside in a garden can really help you mentally. It’s way better than just being stuck inside four walls all the time.

Now, about the pros and cons of living in a flat versus a house. Well, like I mentioned, in a house you usually get more space and a garden, which is great 'cause, you know, taking care of a garden is a fun way to stay active. On the flip side, flats are smaller, so there’s not much to do. You might end up just staring at your screen all day, which isn’t great. 

But then again, an upside of living in a flat is that it’s smaller, so less cleaning, which is a plus! In a house, yeah, you have more to clean since it’s bigger. So, it’s kind of a give and take there. But for me, I still prefer living in a house. 

Now, if we talk about my dream house, oh man, it definitely needs to be near the coast, just so I can smell that ocean breeze, you know? I want tons of windows for natural light, and plenty of open space. A beautiful kitchen with granite countertops and an island in the middle would be perfect. And I’d love spacious bedrooms, just a modern design overall. That’d be like the ultimate dream house if I could build it myself.

Now, switching gears to holiday destinations. What’s my favorite spot? I’d say definitely the coast! I just love the sand, the beach, and the water. When I think of holidays, I picture being with family and friends on the beach, enjoying ice cream.

First of all, being a translator will make him to every day grow up and trying to work into harder English, and he has to accept to a lot of different knowledge in variety of industry. Sometimes he have to translate literature books, which he have to elevate his English skills. Sometimes he have to translate scientific report, which required him to have a large knowledge and know-how about the science industry. Sometimes he have to translate some movie, which he have to have some knowledge about the art or the creative industry. With the diversified requirement from a lot of industry know-how, he will have a higher level of expertise in different industries, which would be a great elevator for him to get a set to another industry if he would love to switch in the future. Because I know that with only English background, you cannot develop your character much larger. English will have you to accept easier to the word knowledge, but you have to be real expertise in some industry, then you can also elevate your career. For being a teacher, it's not a bad idea, but I'm afraid that he will be easier getting satisfied because he has the role of telling somebody the knowledge. Sometimes it will limit him from getting new knowledge. Or being the tour guide, it will help him a lot with the social interaction and when he can learn a lot about how to talk and how to communication. But it will also be a big issue for him to elevate his career when being either a teacher or a tour guide. So last but not least, I think the most suitable role for him to choose is being a translator.","Okay, so my brother just graduated with a bachelor's degree in English, and he’s thinking about which job to go for—either being an English teacher, a translator, or a tour guide. If you ask me, I’d totally recommend he goes for the translator role, and here’s why. 

First off, being a translator really pushes him to grow every day. Like, he’ll be dealing with harder English, and he’ll have to dive into a lot of different knowledge across various industries. Sometimes, he might be translating literature, which means he has to polish up his English skills. Then there are times he’ll need to translate scientific reports, and that requires him to have a good grasp of the science world. And let’s not forget about movies—he’ll need to know something about art and creativity to get that done, too. 

With all these different demands from various industries, he'll build a higher level of expertise, which can really help him if he decides to switch careers later on. I mean, with just an English background, it might not be enough to really grow his career. Sure, English can open doors, but to really move up, he needs to be an expert in a specific field. 

Now, teaching isn’t a bad option, but I’m a bit worried that he might get comfortable too quickly since he’d just be sharing knowledge with others. That could limit his own learning, you know? And being a tour guide would definitely help him with social skills and learning how to communicate, but it might not offer as many chances for career advancement as being a translator.

So, in the end, I really think being a translator is the best fit for him. It’s gonna open up a lot of doors and keep him growing!",8.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U166/HUST0404230051-2.mp3,CD8_1,2

So when it comes to whether I, if somebody ask me if I enjoy my childhood, I would definitely answer that I have really enjoyed it. It's because my parents have been very solicitous about my development, so it seems like they have paid every of their attention to take care of me. They have given me everything. Anyway, they are not over-indulged me. So regarding my favorite hobby when I was a kid was playing games. I can't say that such hobbies is wholesome, but anyway it helped me relax after a sedulous hour of studying. Yeah, you see? It's really good. And besides, I also realized my time playing sports with my friends. We used to play football every afternoon after school. I can say that it gave me one of the most unforgettable memories. When the... It was one occasion that I was so sick that I was heart-beast alive. The doctor said that I was taken down by seasonal flu and my immunity was so weak that it could not resist the disease. And I stayed in the hospital for like a week and my mom had been with me all the time. So that was the moment that I memorized throughout my life.","Okay, so I’m gonna talk about childhood, you know, and if somebody asked me if I enjoyed my childhood, I’d totally say yes, like I really did enjoy it. My parents were super supportive and they paid a lot of attention to my development. They really gave me everything I needed, but they didn’t spoil me, you know? 

So, one of my favorite hobbies when I was a kid was definitely playing games. I mean, I know it’s not the most wholesome hobby, but it helped me relax after long hours of studying, you know? It was really good. Also, I really loved playing sports with my friends. We used to play football every afternoon after school, and those were some of my best memories.

I remember one time, though, I got really sick and it was pretty bad. The doctor said I had seasonal flu and my immune system was just weak, so I ended up in the hospital for about a week. My mom stayed with me the whole time, and I really remember that moment for the rest of my life. ",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_3/audio/HUST6923MMJ3167/HUST0609230245-1.mp3,CD13_3,1

So number one, yes, it's building trust and establishing disciplines. And at the same time, we are sharing ideas. We are sharing ideas how to improve in our workplace. There are also things that we have to share. And there are several ways how to improve teamwork. The leader is not only developing the members to lead each other, I mean to help each other, but at the same time, they also have to guide. So in my workplace, a leader always asks the members about the work, and the members will contribute, will share his or her ideas, and they're going to find out if those ideas are effective for the students. So this is really popular in our school. The principal will always go there to check if the plan that we decided is really appropriate for the students. The possible benefits of teamwork is, number one, it's good for the students. There is a saying that two brains are better than one. So different variations of plan, which has the same goal, will really help each individual student to attain the task on that day. How can we overcome challenges when working in a team? So there are many ways to overcome challenges. Number one, so you have to know that you have the capacity to share your ideas, and you have to be confident enough that your ideas are appropriate for the school policy, and at the same time, school objectives. And we can also have, number two, maybe we can have, okay, or we can have the team will have its individual capacity to know each other. You know, if you build trust, you have to know each other well. So aside from building trust in school, maybe we can have our individual training outside, or we can have bond outside. So when that happens, you already build trust, and you can already form a group where you have same objective for the school. Number two, jealousy and bad attitudes really happen in a working environment. The motivation for each individual should be polished.","Okay, so teamwork is really popular at the school where I’m teaching science right now. Number one, it’s all about building trust and establishing discipline. And, you know, we’re sharing ideas on how to improve things in our workplace. There are definitely things we have to share, and there are several ways to make teamwork better. 

The leader isn't just there to manage; they also help the team members support each other, right? They guide us too. Like, in my workplace, the leader always checks in with us about our work, and we all contribute and share our ideas. Then we can see if those ideas are actually effective for the students. This whole approach is really popular at our school. Our principal even pops in to make sure the plans we come up with are really good for the students. 

Now, the possible benefits of teamwork? Well, first off, it's great for the students. There’s this saying that two brains are better than one, and that’s totally true. Different variations of plans, all aiming for the same goal, really help each individual student make progress on what they need to do.

So, how can we overcome challenges when working in a team? There are a bunch of ways to tackle challenges. First, you really gotta know that you can share your ideas and feel confident that they fit with the school’s policies and objectives. And, then we also need to get to know each other as individuals, right? You know, building trust means understanding each other well. 

Outside of the school, we can have individual training or just bond together. When we do that, we start to build trust, and we can form a stronger group with the same goals for the school. 

But, you know, there can be issues like jealousy and bad attitudes in any workplace. So it’s important that each person’s motivation is kept positive and strong. So, that's how I see teamwork playing out in my school.",8.5,9.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_1/audio/HUST6923V6BY166/HUST0609230020-3.mp3,CD13_1,3

First, it helps us to control our weight. When you eat breakfast, you will feel full and therefore you don't need to eat another snack during the day. The second reason is that breakfast will provide you energy to start the day. Being the first meal of the day, you will need energy and therefore the breakfast can provide it for you and you will feel very healthy for the rest of the day. The third reason is easy preventions. By eating breakfast, we can avoid some disease like vascular disease, some kind of bone disease and we can avoid being skinny. The final reason is the emotional improvement. In my opinion, when we have breakfast, we will not feel tired and hungry anymore for the rest of the day. Therefore, our emotions will be improved and we will feel happy to treat other people and do our work. And now I will answer these follow up questions. For the first question, the types of food that are often served in breakfast are bread, rice, small with small portions and noodles. The negative effects of skipping breakfast are that we do not have energy to kick off a day and therefore we will feel tired and we don't have strength to accomplish the work in that day. Also, by skipping breakfast, we will eat more in lunch and dinner week will make our weight increase and that may cause obesity. In my opinion, a healthy diet is a diet which contains all types of nutrients like protein, stock, vegetables and it has to be done with a reasonable time schedule. The healthy diet has to be divided into three parts. The first is breakfast, the second is lunch and the final is dinner. Also, healthy diets contain a balanced amount of food that we consume. The largest content is in breakfast, the second is in lunch and the final, the smallest is in dinner.","Okay, so I'm gonna start my talk for part three now. So, you know, breakfast is really the most important meal of the day for a few reasons. Like, first off, it helps us control our weight. When you eat breakfast, you feel full, right? So you’re less likely to snack throughout the day. The second reason is it gives you energy to kickstart your day. Being the first meal, it’s important, and having breakfast really helps you feel healthy and ready for whatever comes next.

Now, the third reason is like some easy preventions. Eating breakfast can actually help us avoid certain diseases, like vascular diseases or some bone issues, and it can also help us not be too skinny. And then, the final reason I think is about emotional improvement. I mean, when we have breakfast, we’re not as tired or hungry for the rest of the day, you know? That really helps our mood, so we end up being happier and better at treating other people and getting our work done.

Alright, now I’ll answer some follow-up questions. So, for the first question about food you often have for breakfast, it’s usually things like bread, rice, small portions of different things, and noodles. 

Now, the negative effects of skipping breakfast are pretty significant. If you skip it, you won’t have the energy to start the day, and then you’ll feel exhausted and not strong enough to get your work done. Plus, if you skip breakfast, you tend to eat more at lunch and dinner, which could lead to weight gain or even obesity.

In my opinion, a healthy diet has to include all the necessary nutrients, like protein, carbs, and veggies, and it’s gotta be balanced with a proper schedule. A healthy diet should be split into three parts: first is breakfast, then lunch, and finally, dinner. So, like, the largest portion of food should be for breakfast, the second largest for lunch, and the smallest for dinner. That way, you’re making sure you get what you need throughout the day.",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_1/audio/HUST281123Q63S177/HUST2811230069-3.mp3,CD17_1,3
audio/HUST30523GBJG167/HUST3005230138-3.ogg," Yes, I'm in favor of the opinion that university is a memorable time of our life because of those reasons. The first one is that when we are in the university, we have the independence like from our parents because when we are in university, we don't have to inform to our parents about our schedules and our, for example, foods to eat like we are in high school when we are living with our parents. The second one is that studying in university will have us to achieve more knowledge because the university requires a high level of knowledge. It's not like the general knowledge when we study in high school but it's like the more special and more knowledgeable knowledge. We will learn from the experts like a doctor or a master from that fields of knowledge. And the third one is that when we are at university, we can have a wide range of social networking because when we are at university, we can meet a lot of students from all regions of the country. It will have us to open our relationship and will create some relationships that we will keep it for a long time later. And maybe we can find a close friend or maybe a lover when we're in university because love in university may be very nice and wonderful one of our life. And the final one is that in university, we can improve soft skills by, for example, join clubs like voluntary club or academic clubs and we can also participate in the academic competitions to acknowledge and to improve our soft skills. And what I find the most memorable about my university time is that I have joined a really great club when I meet wonderful people. Universities now is not the same as they were in the past because it's more modern and it has more well developed. And in my opinion, university should add to","Okay, so I totally agree that university is, like, a super memorable time in our lives, and I've got a few reasons for that. First off, when we're in university, we kinda get this independence from our parents, right? I mean, we don't have to tell them everything, like our schedules or what we’re eating, the way we did in high school when we lived at home. It’s all about being free to make our own choices.

Then, there’s the whole knowledge thing. Studying at university really pushes us to reach a higher level of understanding. It's not just the basic stuff we learned in high school; it's way more specialized. We're learning from experts, like doctors or professors who really know their fields.

And another big point is the social networking aspect. At university, you meet tons of people from all over the country. It's such a great opportunity to build relationships that can last a long time. And who knows? You might even meet a close friend or, like, a partner. I think falling in love in university can be pretty amazing.

Lastly, university helps us boost our soft skills, you know? We can join clubs, like volunteer groups or academic ones, and participate in competitions which really helps us grow our skills. Personally, I have some of my best memories from being in a great club where I met some truly awesome people.

Universities today are different from how they used to be—they're way more modern and developed now. And I think there's even more they could add to the experience.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD10_2/audio/HUST30523GBJG167/HUST3005230138-3.mp3,CD10_2,3

I was involved in motor accidents when I was the first year in my university when I was trying to drive my new motorbike in Vietnam. There are a lot of motorbikes to drive and it's common for students to have their own vehicles. I mostly got into accidents because of my driving techniques. In order to travel into accidents in the future, I have to drive very carefully and pay very great attention on the direction as well as the brake I'm using. In the future, if I see someone who gets injured in a road accident, I will try to firstly call the ambulance and secondly call the police and have them get out of the accident as fast as possible because I know that in an accident there was a lot of people suffering. Speaking about music, to be honest, I really don't into music very much. I only use music as a method for me to focus more on my studying as well as on my working. I usually listen to some meditation music. Yes, I can play some musical instruments. I love playing piano. I try to maintain my routine of playing piano 30 minutes to one hour per day to have my brain most activated to kickstart my day every morning. As I mentioned before, I love listening to music while studying or working with some meditation music because it helps me to concentrate more on my work or my studying. you","So, I’ve actually been injured in road accidents more than once before, but it’s been quite a while since my last one, thankfully. The first time I got into an accident was when I was in my first year at university in Vietnam. I was just starting to drive my new motorbike, and, you know, there are a ton of motorbikes around; it’s really common for students to have their own bikes. I mostly got into accidents because of my driving skills, or, well, lack of them at that time. 

To avoid accidents in the future, I really have to drive super carefully and pay close attention to the road—like, to the direction and brakes I’m using.

I mean, I know that in an accident, there are often a lot of people suffering, and it’s important to act fast.

Now, talking about music, honestly, I’m not really into it all that much. I mostly just use music to help me focus when I’m studying or working. I usually listen to some meditation music for that. Oh, and yes, I can play some musical instruments! I love playing the piano. I try to keep up a routine of playing for about 30 minutes to an hour every day to help get my brain activated and kickstart my mornings.

This trend can be understood that traveling is really beneficial for everyone. There are a number of main benefits of traveling that are making new friends, gaining new knowledge, relaxing and also improving their adaptability to the world. Firstly, when we travel to a different place other than our own place, we can contact with many other people who are not, who maybe are not the same as us and not the same nationality or the same culture as us, so we can have more friends from many parts of the world. Secondly, traveling can help us gain much more knowledge in many different aspects. When we travel to a foreign country, for example, we can, from native people, we can know their cultural identity, we can know about their, maybe we can improve our language competency, about the way people treat others, and it helps us to improve our knowledge about not only the culture but also the history, the geography and the like. The third benefit of traveling is it helps us relax. I believe that when we decide to travel, we always wish to have an ideal travel with a lot of interesting activities, happy, delighted time. So if we have a wonderful holiday, wonderful travel, we can unwind after a hard-working time and we can come back to our work with more happy and positive mood. One more benefit of traveling, I believe it has is it helps us to open our mind and improve our open-mindedness and adaptability to the cultural difference. As I mentioned previously, when we travel to another country or another culture, we know about their culture and know the native history and geography and people, so it helps us to understand and sympathize the difference between people and different cultures so that we can easily adapt to the difference. We work in a multidiverse, multicultural environment, so all in all, traveling is really good for everyone.","Okay, so I wanna talk about traveling and how it's becoming super popular these days. You know, lots of people are traveling not just in their own cities or countries, but all around the world. And I think this trend makes total sense 'cause traveling really has some great benefits for everyone. 

First off, one of the main perks of traveling is making new friends. When we go to a new place, we meet people from different cultures and backgrounds—people who aren’t like us at all. So, it’s a perfect chance to expand our friendship circle across the globe. 

Then, there's the whole gaining knowledge part. Like, when you visit another country, you get to learn so much from the locals. You know, you pick up on their cultural identity, and maybe even improve your language skills while you’re at it. Plus, you get to dive into their history and geography, which is pretty awesome.

And, honestly, traveling is a fantastic way to relax. I mean, when we plan a trip, we're usually hoping for a fun experience filled with interesting activities. After all that hard work, having a great holiday can really help us unwind and come back refreshed and in a good mood.

Another benefit of traveling is that it opens our minds. I really believe that when you experience different cultures, it helps us to better understand and appreciate the differences among people. This kind of exposure makes it easier to adapt to new situations, especially when we work in diverse and multicultural environments.

So, yeah, traveling really does a lot of good for everyone. It's not just about seeing new places; it's about connecting, learning, and growing as individuals.",8.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD12/audio/HUST2823DGI2167/HUST0208230031-3.mp3,CD12,3

I'm considering putting it on a Facebook wall because well this means everybody can see that I have wished her a good happy birthday and when everybody sees this, they will also know or realize that it is her birthday that day and they will wish her happy birthday as well which is a really nice thing to do considering the fact that not only me but also the other people will know that it's her birthday and they will give her the best wishes and I think that I highly believe that it will make her become a lot happier. I think that it will make her become a dog with two tails. Another option that I'm really considering is making a phone call to her. Now with the development of technology, I think we can all agree that we can always give a phone call to anybody to anywhere in the world whether they are living abroad or living inside the country. Now when making a phone call, we can choose to video call her and this means that we can not only see each other's expressions but also we can see each other's faces after a long time without seeing each other and I think that this is one of the best choices because I can really see how happy she is after being wished happy birthday by one of her close friends which is me of course. Now another option worth considering here is sending her a card. Now this is because sending her a card means a lot. She is a person who likes cards a lot and making her a card also means that I can freely customize the cards to her liking. I'm sitting on the fence wondering which option should I choose but I think that sending her a card would be very nice because well she mentioned before that she really likes the cards which have the symbols of Hanoi, the temple of Lichra of Hanoi and I think that buying her that card would be very meaningful to her because well that is one of the things that she wants. Now at a loose end, I think that I will make this card for her whenever I find myself at the loose end and maybe I will send her a few days before her birthday. Yeah I think that out of three options I think that sending her a card would be the nicest thing that anyone including me could do for her.","Okay, so I wanna talk about how I'm gonna wish my friend a happy birthday. I mean, there's just so many ways to do it, and I feel like, come rain or shine, I've really gotta pick one. So, one option I'm thinking about is putting a birthday message on her Facebook wall. You know, this way, everyone can see that I wished her a happy birthday, and all our friends will notice, too. They'll jump in and wish her well, which is just really nice, right? I totally believe it'll make her super happy—like, you know, she’ll be like a dog with two tails or something.

Another option I'm considering is giving her a phone call. I mean, thanks to technology, we can just call anyone, anywhere, whether they're abroad or just in the next town over. And, like, we could even video call! That way, we can see each other's faces and expressions after not having seen each other for a while. I think that would be one of the best choices because I really wanna see how happy she gets when I wish her a happy birthday, you know?

Then there's the idea of sending her a card, which is also really cool. She loves cards a lot, and if I make one, I can totally customize it just for her. I'm kinda sitting on the fence right now, trying to decide which way to go. But honestly, I think sending her a card would be really nice, especially since she once said she really likes cards that have symbols from Hanoi, like the Temple of Literature. I feel like if I buy or make her that card, it would mean a lot to her because it’s something she wants.

I think that going to the museum will be more famous in the future because it can have us to provide a rich source of information like about the history of human, the history of the country, and to relax after working day or share knowledge about the things that we saw in the museum to other people, and another benefit of going to the museum is we can have a chance to dig into the work, the masterpiece of many authors or know exactly the root of our ancestors. I think that there are many ways to encourage youngsters to learn about the past. We can organize some talk show to talk about the history of our ancestors, of our feet, of our victories in a new way, like some game show, some talk show. In addition to this, we can let the young people to watch the documentary film like Mu Go Chai or another film about the world war, the Vietnamese war against French or USA, and let them...","Okay, so I wanna talk about, you know, how we can encourage young people to go to museums.

Plus, when you go to a museum, you get to share what you learn with others, which is pretty cool.

Another great thing about museums is that they give us a chance to dive into the work and masterpieces of a lot of different artists, plus learn more about where we come from, like, our ancestors. 

I believe there are many ways we can get young folks interested in learning about the past. Like, for example, we could organize some fun talk shows to discuss the history of our ancestors, our feet, and our victories, but in a new and exciting way, maybe through game shows or something like that.

First of all, those markets are a part of the tradition of Vietnamese people. In the open-air market, a wide range of goods are available from meat, vegetables, flowers, candies and biscuits, decoration things, and especially the cherry blossom which in Vietnamese, huà đạo, and the kumquat trees. And those are all essential things that Vietnamese people need to get for a date holiday. Compared to other two options, which are a department store and a supermarket, open-air market are more comfortable to buy because there is fresh air when you can walk around and interact with other people who are buying things as well. The department stores are quite stuffy and we have to walk into one building. I expect that there are also many people coming into the department store as well, which makes it a quite crowded place. And also the price in department stores is way much higher than in local markets. The other option is supermarkets, which I find is also a nearly good choice. However, there is still a limitation in choices as the special plants such as cherry blossom and kumquat trees are sometimes not displayed in the supermarket. And also the meat and veggies in some of the kits are not as fresh as the open-air market, which I choose.","Okay, so when I need to do some shopping for a holiday or a special occasion, I really prefer to hit up an open-air market. First off, those markets are like a big part of our Vietnamese culture, you know? At the open-air market, you can find all sorts of stuff—like meat, vegetables, flowers, candies, biscuits, decorations, and especially the cherry blossoms, which we call ""huà đạo"" in Vietnamese, and the kumquat trees too. These things are pretty essential for us Vietnamese when it comes to preparing for a holiday.

Now, when I compare it to the other two options, which are a department store and a supermarket, I just find open-air markets way more enjoyable. There's this nice, fresh air that makes it comfortable to walk around, and you get to chat and interact with other shoppers too. Whereas, department stores can be kind of stuffy since you're stuck in one building, and there are usually tons of people crammed in there, so it gets pretty crowded. Plus, the prices at department stores are usually so much higher than at local markets.

Then there's supermarkets, which are almost a good option, but they do have their downsides. Like, sometimes you'll find that the special plants, like cherry blossoms and kumquat trees, aren’t even available there.

Yes, that is correct, I would agree with that. Because if you look at social media and all the pictures and images that people post of life and then you would think that they are living the perfect life and I want to live that life as well on holiday all the time and smiling and happy. But in reality when you look at their lives without the images that they display on social media it's not as happy or as glamorous as one would think. So it gives you a really unreal view of life. The internet usually gives us this bright colourful depiction of what life is, but in real life it's very very difficult, hard and negative. So I would say it's very very true unreal view of life. The second one is less face to face communication. Yes, because a lot of people spend more and more time on devices and not going out with friends, doing things, being active, having face to face communication. More and more people start to have relationships over the internet or over the device. So even more and more interviews are conducted over the internet. So you don't have that face to face communication or interaction with that person. Less privacy, yes, there is a lot going on on the internet. A lot of hackers, people can come and steal your privacy and also a lot of sites ask for interviews or private questions. Some of my own ideas is the internet has a lot of negative images and videos. Like with unreal life, it exposes people to a lot of bad images in life. So I would say that it's very important to have a lot of people in real life, not just people in real life. So one would have to be very careful when using the internet and try and avoid or ignore all the negative and bad things like all the sexual stuff happening, all the nasty videos and images on there. Alright, and just some follow up questions. You do not need to answer all these questions. What activities do people often do on the internet? While communicating or watching videos, especially scrolling on their phones through social media. Most people do do work, but often people just waste time on the internet. It's time wasting. How has the internet changed the way people communicate? Well, it's very easy now to communicate with someone from across the world just by clicking a few buttons. So in that sense it made it easier for people to communicate, but also it's not a very good thing because people spend more and more time on their devices and not in the moment with the people around them that's closest to them at that moment.

But then when you really think about it and look behind those images, their actual lives aren’t as glamorous or as happy as it seems. So it gives you this really unrealistic picture of life. The internet kinda paints this bright, colorful version of life, but in reality, it’s actually, like, really tough and full of challenges. So yeah, I definitely think that’s a super true point.

Now, moving on to the second one, which is less face-to-face communication. Yeah, 'cause a lot of people are just spending so much time on their devices instead of going out with friends, being active, and having those in-person conversations. More and more people are starting to form relationships online or through screens. Even job interviews are happening over the internet now, so you’re missing out on that personal touch and interaction. 

And then there’s the whole privacy thing. Yeah, that’s a big deal too. There's so much happening online, with hackers and stuff. People can invade your privacy, and a lot of websites are asking for personal info or private questions. 

I also think the internet exposes people to a lot of negative images and videos. Like with that unreal view of life, it pumps a lot of bad images into people’s lives. So it’s really important to have real-life connections, not just online ones. I mean, you have to be super careful when using the internet and try to avoid or just ignore all the negative stuff like all that sexual content or those nasty videos.

Alright, and just some quick follow-up questions. You don’t have to answer all of them, though. So what activities do people usually do on the internet? Well, a lot of people are either communicating or watching videos, especially just scrolling through social media on their phones. Most people do some work too, but honestly, a lot of time gets wasted online. It’s just time-consuming. 

And how has the internet changed the way people communicate? Well, it’s so easy now to connect with someone from the other side of the world with just a few clicks. So that's a good thing, right? But at the same time, it can be a downside because people spend more time on their devices instead of being present with the people who are actually around them, like family or friends or a girlfriend. So yeah, it really depends on your situation.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_3/audio/HUST2811234Q4J167/HUST2811230261-3.mp3,CD17_3,3

First of all, in terms of reading clubs, I think the boy can practice reading by reading books, reading some material, or reading comics at home. But without any guidance from the teacher, I think he can do it by himself. Moreover, about a guitar club, as I remember before, she also said to me that her son could play the guitar when he was just 6 years old. So I think with an 8 year old child, I think participating in chess club is very perfect because playing chess brings him a lot of advantages. First and foremost, playing chess is beneficial to his mental and physical health. He can practice his brain, which helps boost his creativity and intelligence. So I think he can take up playing chess and register in chess club, which is very good for him to be more clever and smart in the future. I think he can do it by himself.","Okay, so in my opinion, I’d go with chess clubs for my friend's son for a couple of reasons. First off, like, reading clubs are cool and all, but I think the boy can work on his reading skills at home by checking out books, materials, or even comics by himself. I mean, without a teacher guiding him, he can still handle that.

Now, about the guitar club—if I remember right, she mentioned that her son could actually play the guitar when he was just six! So, for an eight-year-old, I really think joining a chess club would be perfect. Playing chess has so many benefits. For one thing, it's great for both his mental and physical health. Chess helps him exercise his brain, which can boost his creativity and intelligence. So, you know, I really believe he should dive into playing chess and sign up for that chess club—it’d be super good for him to get smarter and sharper in the future.

So sometimes when I have free time I go to chat with my parents or my young brother. Now my young brother studies abroad in Korea and the internet is the best way to have my keeping talk with him.

There's a lot of interesting and good restaurants around our city, Hanoi. One of the restaurants that I like the most is Hui restaurant. I was born in Teng Ho and I grew up in Teng Ho and now I live in Hanoi. Once I had a chance to come to Hui and the food there was really awesome. So when we come back to Hanoi, to Hui restaurant, it gives me a chance to taste the delicious food of Hui again. Okay, for the next question. What type of food does it serve? In Hui restaurant, they serve Hui food. Of course, they serve Hui food, Hui traditional food. I like almost all of them. I like almost all of them like Banh Bel or something like that, but not everything. Some kind of sauce is too salty or sometimes it's too spicy for me. So I love Hui food but not all of them. Yeah. About the third question. What do you like most about eating in a restaurant? Yeah, eating in a restaurant gives me a lot of opportunities like, you know, when we eat at home, we have a lot of things to prepare the vegetables, the meat, the fish, the dish, the cooking equipment and so on. And after the meal, we have to wash the dish, to clean up or the kitchen. So I think, I believe that eating in a restaurant is much more convenient and that's the reason why I like eating in a restaurant. Okay about games. Yeah, I enjoy playing games. It helps me to relax after a long day working. I can relax with my favorite game. I like type of games like chess. When I want to try, I also play chess with my friend, but the chess whenever I try is offline and now it's online. Yeah, thank you.","Okay, hey there! So, first off, I wanna talk about my favorite restaurant. You know, there are so many good restaurants in our city, Hanoi, and one that I really love is this place called Hui restaurant. I was actually born and raised in Teng Ho, but now I live in Hanoi. And like, I remember when I first got to try the food at Hui, it was just amazing! Every time I go back to Hanoi, I always look forward to tasting the delicious food at Hui again.

So, what kind of food do they serve? Well, at Hui restaurant, they serve Hui food, of course! It's like, all about the traditional Hui dishes. I pretty much like almost everything, like Banh Bel and stuff like that. But I gotta say, not all of it is perfect for me. Sometimes some of the sauces are just way too salty or a bit too spicy for my taste. So while I love Hui food, I’m kinda picky about a few things.

Now, moving on to what I like most about eating in a restaurant. You know, dining out gives me a lot of opportunities. It’s just so much easier. When we eat at home, we gotta prep everything like the veggies, meat, fish, and deal with all the cooking stuff. And then, after we eat, we have to clean up all the dishes and the kitchen too, which is such a hassle. So, I really believe that eating in a restaurant is way more convenient, and that’s why I enjoy it so much.

And, yeah, about games—totally enjoy playing them! It helps me chill out after a long day at work. I like playing games like chess with my friends.

As a student, I don't live in Hanoi so I use a lot of math when I study in Hanoi, University of Science and Technology. For myself, I prefer using electronic math because it is convenient and easier for me to find exactly where I want to go. Actually, I ask a lot of people in Hanoi about directions where I want to go, about some locations, some areas. Instead of using math, they cannot tell me exactly where I want to go. After that, I decided I myself use internet and electronic math on my smartphone to find where I want to go, to find the location. Let's talk about my favorite room in my house. Actually, I live in a small house in Hanoi and my favorite room is my bedroom because this one was decorated by my dad. My dad decorated this room for me for my 18th birthday. I often use this room for not only sleeping but also for studying. Actually, there is one more thing I want to change in my room. I want to have more windows. Why do I want to say that? Because my room right now has a small window and I want one more. I love fresh air and I love to enjoy the sunlight. If there is one more window, I can spend my time in the room to look at some viewing, some sights. I want to have one more window and I don't want to change anything else except the window. This is decorated by my father and I respect my father.","Hey teachers! So, in today’s world, it’s way easier for me to use electronics for math. As a student, I don’t live in Hanoi, but when I study at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, I definitely use math a lot. Personally, I really like using electronic tools for math because it’s convenient and helps me find exactly where I wanna go. You know, I’ve actually asked a bunch of people in Hanoi for directions to places, and it’s kinda funny, but they can’t usually tell me where I need to go. So, I figured, why not just use the internet and electronic maps on my smartphone? That works way better for finding locations.

Now, let’s talk about my favorite room in my house. I live in a small house in Hanoi, and my favorite room is definitely my bedroom. The cool thing is, my dad decorated this room for me on my 18th birthday. I use this room not just for sleeping but also for studying. 

Oh, and there’s one thing I really wanna change in my room. I wish I could have more windows. Basically, my room only has one small window right now, and I’d love to have another one. I just really enjoy fresh air and soaking up the sunlight. If I had that extra window, I could spend more time in my room enjoying the view and the sights outside.

I mean, when you're in a museum, you can actually see evidence of history, right? And when you see that evidence, it kinda makes you feel connected to how people lived back then and what they went through, and you get to understand their culture. You know, it's like we learn better when we can actually see things for ourselves.

I mean, sure, reading a history book or watching a documentary at home helps a lot too, but it just doesn’t feel as real as being in a museum. And when you're there, you might even meet some knowledgeable people, and you can ask them about the things that you’re curious about. That's super helpful because it gives you more ideas and answers you need.

And, you know, for foreign students, going to a museum gives them a better understanding of the culture. They can really feel what the ancient people went through. It's like an experience you just can't have if you're at home reading or watching on a screen. 

From my experience, whenever I visit museums, I get so passionate about learning more. I want to dig deeper into the lives of the people from the past, and even though they’re gone, their legacy is still around us. The history is right there, and I want to know more about it.

So, going to museums, seeing the evidence, meeting people who know stuff, and having discussions about how people lived back then and what they faced, I think it really helps you enjoy learning history. It's real evidence and solid sources, so it’s super effective.",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230271-2.mp3,CD16_3,2

There are three options that I'm considering such as a plan, a bottle of perfume and a piece of kitchenware. In my opinion, a plan is my best choice because of some following reasons.

Secondly, when his mother is watering a plant, she can reduce stress and feel very happy. In contrast, there are several reasons that I don't choose another option. Firstly, I don't choose a bottle of perfume and a piece of kitchenware because it's very expensive. My friend is a student so they don't have so much money to buy this. In the future, they can give her mother a bottle of perfume and a piece of kitchenware. The second reason is that it's very hard to choose with his mother's light.

Now, there are a couple of reasons why I’m not into the other options. First, I think a bottle of perfume and kitchenware can be pretty pricey. Since my friend’s a student, he doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on those things. Maybe in the future he can get her perfume or some nice kitchenware, but right now, it's just not doable.

And I tend to mostly listen to the radio when I'm driving to work and my commute to work takes 30 minutes and I think it's a very good way to catch up on the news as I'm driving because the news comes on when I'm driving at the time when I'm driving and also tells me about the radio channel the DJ talks about the traffic on the road so if I know about that then I would avoid those roads or take a different route to work.

audio/HUST6923DQQK177/HUST0609230195-3.ogg," Well, it is true that nowadays students tend to visit a foreign country for different reasons. And I think that visiting a foreign country is beneficial for students because of several reasons. Visiting a foreign country will help students to increase their knowledge because when students go to another country to study, they will meet lecturers in pre-teachers universities and they can access to the most updated documentaries and textbooks and also they experience a very high standard of education. Secondly, visiting another country will help students to have good memories. I think that visiting a foreign country is a good opportunity for them because they will experience a lot of interesting things like a new culture and to experience a lot of food, a lot of drink and something like the history of that country. Thirdly, they can make a lot of new friends here because when the students study in another country they can meet a lot of new friends and that will help them a lot in the future. In short, visiting a foreign country is beneficial in several ways. Now I will answer the follow-up questions. Going abroad for holiday is quite popular in my country because people nowadays have a better standard of life than those in the past. So if they have an amount of money, they will use that money to relax after the hard working days. It's like going abroad for a holiday instead of going somewhere in a domestic country like that. As for me, the disadvantages for traveling abroad is firstly, it's the language barrier because if we can speak that native language, we can't communicate anything to the foreigners and it will create the difficulty to order food, to book a plan ticket or to book a hotel room and we have to prepare a lot before we go to a foreign country.","Okay, so, it's true that nowadays a lot of students are choosing to visit foreign countries for different reasons, right? And I really think that going abroad is super beneficial for students for a bunch of reasons. First off, when students go to another country to study, they get to meet lecturers at universities and have access to the latest documentaries and textbooks. Plus, they experience a really high standard of education, which is awesome.

Then, there's the whole thing about making great memories. I mean, visiting a foreign country gives students a fantastic opportunity to dive into new cultures, try all sorts of different foods and drinks, and learn about the country's history. It’s just a really rich experience overall.

Also, while studying abroad, they can make tons of new friends, you know? Meeting new people can really help them out in the future, so that's another great reason to study in a different country.

So, in short, visiting a foreign country really has a lot of benefits. Now, if we talk about going abroad for a holiday, that's pretty popular in my country these days too. People have a better standard of living now compared to the past. So, if they have some extra cash, they tend to spend it on vacations abroad instead of just traveling within the country.

But, I gotta say, there are some disadvantages to traveling abroad. First up, there's that whole language barrier thing. If you don’t speak the local language, it can be really tough to chat with locals. It makes ordering food, booking plane tickets, or getting a hotel room pretty difficult, you know? So, it definitely means you have to prepare a lot before heading to a foreign country.",8.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_2/audio/HUST6923DQQK177/HUST0609230195-3.mp3,CD13_2,3

I'm closer to my mother because she has been going easier on me rather than my father. When I'm together, I really want to have her going to eat a meal with me. Just I really want to live with my parents when I get married because I can take care of them when they got old. What is the most interesting question you have asked me? Yes, I often listen to music because it makes me relax and I can focus on work. My website, I think it should be YouTube, the most common music video website on the web right now. There are lots of bands and genre on it. Yeah, like I said, on YouTube there are lots of bands and genre that I can find about and to listen to. Otherwise, on YouTube there will be lots of videos about the bands I love and I can study about them too through the videos on it.","Okay, so, the most interesting question you’ve asked me? Well, I think it’s really interesting, you know? I mean, I’m definitely closer to my mom because she’s just a bit easier on me compared to my dad. When we’re together, I really wanna go out and have meals with her. Honestly, I wanna live with my parents even after I get married. Like, I really wanna be there for them and take care of them when they get older. 

And yeah, about that question again, I often listen to music ’cause it helps me relax and focus on my work, you know? I’d say YouTube is my go-to site for music. It’s like the most popular music video site out there right now. There are tons of bands and all sorts of genres on it. I mean, it’s great! Like I said, on YouTube, I can find so many bands and genres to explore and listen to. Plus, there are loads of videos about the bands I love, so I can learn about them too through their videos on there.",8.5,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_3/audio/HUST111223NEPL166/HUST1112230207-1.mp3,CD14_3,1
audio/HUST30523GBJG166/HUST3005230105-3.ogg," I think the parents are the best teachers, I think it's just simply because they spend the most time, yes they are closer to the children than others right, so the children spend the most time with them and I think they are also the most influential, some in a normal household I think that children look up to their parents, they take their parents as a role model right, also the parents they of course they understand their children the most, they understand that the children's strength, the children's weakness because you know they've been with the children since they were born, so a lot of time spent together and maybe you know father and child, parent and child maybe they are born between them just to understand their better. Like in you know in Vietnam how the role of the parent, in Vietnam in the past 10 years around like 2010 definitely maybe up in the north side of Vietnam I think that the parent is used to like force things on their child right, not like in the weird way but like you know they make the choice for their children instead of you know exploring the child ability. I feel like nowadays with the media and our staff and you know the emerged culture between the west and the east, the parents have become more and more open minded, you know they often ask what they like, you know what they want them to do in the future, what their passion and I think that is a really good improvement compared to the past. In my opinion I think that parents also a bad teacher in the area that all the environment around the children are like from their early on to you know maybe university or the environment around them are created by their parents right. So you know for example their friends in the childhood right, that's because the parents choose to live in that neighborhood, their friend is school because the parents choose for them to go to that school. So with the ability to create environment definitely parents can be a good teacher also because they create the environments they understand it better than anyone else and you know with the understanding of the environment, with the understanding of the child, I think that they could be a good teacher giving some good advice, some family you know, I think some family definitely like with father and son, they just like to rip the car of each other right. So I think that's a clear example of how parents can be a good teacher.","Okay, so, I think parents are like, the best teachers, you know? And it’s really just because they spend the most time with their kids. I mean, they’re closer to their children than anyone else, right? So, kids really look up to their parents and, like, see them as role models. Plus, parents really understand their kids—like, they know their strengths and weaknesses because they’ve been with them since they were born. 

And the bond between a parent and child, I feel like, helps them understand each other better. Like, in Vietnam, the role of parents over the past, I’d say, ten years, especially around 2010, well, up north, parents used to kind of force their choices on their kids. Not in a bad way or anything, but, like, they’d decide things for them instead of letting the kids explore their own abilities, you know?

But nowadays, I think with all the media and the mix of Western and Eastern cultures, parents are becoming more open-minded. They actually ask their kids what they like, what they wanna do in the future, and what their passions are. And honestly, that’s a really good improvement compared to how it used to be.

Now, don’t get me wrong—I think parents can be bad teachers too, especially when it comes to the environment around their kids. Like, from early childhood to university, the environment is shaped by their parents, right? For example, the friends they have in childhood are often because their parents chose to live in a certain neighborhood, or they picked a school for them. So, with the ability to create that environment, parents definitely have the power to be good teachers too, just because they understand it better than anyone else. 

So, I think, with their understanding of everything around them and how their child fits into it, parents can give solid advice. Like, really, you see how in some families, the dad and the kid, they just connect over fixing cars together, right? That's, I think, a clear example of how parents can be great teachers.",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD10_2/audio/HUST30523GBJG166/HUST3005230105-3.mp3,CD10_2,3
audio/HUST311023PTXC166/HUST3110230105-2.ogg," Well, also for my first week, a group of students want to buy their clothes. So I think maybe they should go to a shopping mall. There are some reasons why I choose to buy in a shopping mall. Firstly, because in a shopping mall, there are many brands, so you or the study may have many options for their choice. And besides that, they can easily change many clothes until they have the clothes which are suitable for them. Thirdly, because the price of clothes in a shopping mall is about a reasonable price for students. The reason I don't choose the online shop is because in the online shop, you can only see the image of the clothes. So you can wear it to yourself. So maybe it's not fit your body. Or maybe the quality of the clothes is not meet your demands. I think the open air market is sometimes very crowded. And maybe the quality of the open air market is not good. I think the bad option for students to buy themselves clothes is probably the most expensive option. So I think that's the reason why I choose the online shop. I think the good option for students to buy themselves clothes is probably the most expensive option. I think the good option for students to buy themselves clothes is probably the most expensive option.","Okay, so for my first week, there's this group of students who want to buy some clothes. I really think they should head to a shopping mall for a few reasons. First of all, in a shopping mall, you know, there's a bunch of different brands, so they’ll have a lot of options to choose from. Plus, they can easily try on a bunch of different clothes until they find what's right for them. And also, the prices at a shopping mall are usually pretty reasonable for students, which is great.

Now, I wouldn't really recommend shopping online. Like, in an online shop, you only get to see pictures of the clothes, right? You can't actually try them on, so they might not fit well, or the quality might not be what you expect. And then there's open-air markets, which, honestly, can be super crowded and the quality there might not be the best either. 

So, like, I think that's why the shopping mall is the better choice. Buying clothes online can sometimes end up being the most expensive option too, and that's just not the best move for students. So yeah, overall, I really think the shopping mall is the way to go.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC166/HUST3110230105-2.mp3,CD16_2,2

Besides its benefits, there are still some disadvantages of living in a flat. The first one is the most apparent. When you live in an apartment, there are limited space. Most apartments are from 60 to more than 100 meters square. If you live in a cheap price apartment, there will be a risk for you to lack of natural light, lack of space for living at a bank or the low charge for storing your stuff. The second thing is that some of the less serious apartments are restricted from adopting pets, such as dogs and cats. If you are a dog lover or a cat lover and you are considering to live in an apartment, you should read. You should read the building regulations clearly and thoroughly to decide whether you should buy them or not. The most important thing is that you should share your place with other people. There will be a chance for you to encounter annoying neighbors who may turn on music the whole day, who may make weird noises and suffer from it. Even when you live in an apartment, sometimes you have to consider what you do and what noise you make. Some low-rise apartments don't have an effective way to restrict themselves to neighboring rooms. There is one thing from my perspective that is the disadvantage of living in an apartment. You can live in an apartment that blocks the chance for you to immerse through natural shrouding. When you live in a house, at least you have a chance to grow more plants and you will enjoy the environment around you. When you live in an apartment, you will see the air without any plants, without any animals. Sometimes the view will be boring and it's not real to you. But anyway, in conclusion, living in an apartment is a solution for those who don't have much money and want to live in a house in the city. But there are still some drawbacks of living in an apartment that can be named for a mention. Thank you.","Okay, so nowadays, because there's not a lot of land, a lot of people are choosing to live in apartments, right? But, you know, while there are benefits, there are also some downsides to living in a flat. The first one is, like, super obvious. When you live in an apartment, you have limited space. Most apartments range from, like, 60 to over 100 square meters. And if you go for a cheaper apartment, you might end up with, like, not enough natural light or not enough space to live comfortably, you know, or even have a hard time storing your stuff.

The second thing is that a lot of those less expensive apartments don’t allow pets, like dogs and cats. So, if you're someone who loves animals and you’re thinking about moving into an apartment, then, like, really read the building rules carefully to see if you can have pets or not. 

Also, living in an apartment means you have to share your space with other people. So, you might have to deal with annoying neighbors who play music all day or make weird noises, and that can be super frustrating. Even when you live in an apartment, sometimes you gotta think about what you’re doing and how loud you’re being. Some lower-rise apartments, they don’t have good soundproofing either, which doesn’t help.

And, I think one big downside of living in an apartment is that it kinda blocks your chance to truly connect with nature. When you live in a house, at least you can grow some plants and enjoy the environment around you. But in an apartment, it’s like, you end up looking out at just concrete with no plants or animals around. Sometimes, the view can be really dull and makes it feel kinda lifeless, you know?

But, anyway, to wrap it up, living in an apartment can work for people who don’t have a lot of money and want to be close to the city, right?

We don't have time, we're definitely going to do it online, we do lots of chatting, video calls. So about what we often do together, basically we're just doing some basic activities like going to coffee shops and then going shopping together. Probably we'll have more time, we're going to spend a couple of days for short picnics or going outside the city for just a retreat. How do you feel about your new life? Well, I have to say it's not very easy for me to make friends with others. I normally become very shy when I meet new people, but once I get used to them, I can be very very active, talkative. I would love to share a lot of other activities with them. Normally I will show them my attention so that I'm ready to make friends. We start with small talks and then we do a lot of messaging through Facebook or Instagram and then slowly we're talking to friends. How do you feel about your new lifestyle?

We love to eat good food, go to great restaurants and then we talk a lot about our day. Well, I have to spend nearly 8 hours every 5 days a week at our work. So it's very stressful.

audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230207-3.ogg," After school activities are the best common extracurricular activities for students. This is for reasons best known. Most students take extracurricular activities to be able to help them read more books, do homework, research and also help them to improve on their academic excellence. Reasons why I would like students to have an after school activity is because this gives them a particular knowledge and it makes them able to boost themselves and to be able to work in a group and an individual manner to be able to enhance their academic excellence and they can perform more in school and also you can give them more experience also in life because extra after school activities really enhances the student's capability mentally and physically both at school and at work and also among friends. What should be done to encourage students participation in extracurricular activity? I would say sport. Sport is good, a library is good. Sports for example enhances the student's mental and physical being giving them more experience and a more visual way in able to enhance the mental abilities and physical abilities which also helps in communication and also helps in guaranteeing a physical structure for more students. A library also will really help effectively because it actually embodies the student's way to be able to get more research, do more activities like homework and extra work from school and also encourages the students to be able to see into their mindset and able to be able to read more and able to be able to be active more in participating in group work and individual activities. So I would say after school activities is the best way to be able to enhance most students in doing well academically. One other contribution to after school activities is that it enhances communication. It builds more time management. It encourages students to be able to stay focused. It gives them more energy to be able to be productive in both in the mental and on the physical aspect while they are doing that activities. I would also say that after school activities, it's endurance because it brings out the practicality of more students by enhancing their ability to be able to do more academically in response to their difficulties in studying.","Okay, so after-school activities are really, like, some of the best common extracurricular things for students. And there are some reasons for that, you know? Most students get into extracurricular activities so they can read more books, do homework, research, and honestly, just improve their academic performance. 

One of the reasons I think students should totally get into after-school activities is 'cause it gives them specific knowledge. It helps them boost their confidence, whether they're working in a group or individually, which can really enhance their academic success. Plus, it gives them experiences in life because these after-school activities can really boost a student’s skills, both mentally and physically, whether it’s at school, work, or even hanging out with friends.

Now, how can we encourage students to join in on these extracurricular activities? Well, I'd say sports are a great option. Sports are awesome—they help students' mental and physical health and give them valuable experiences. They also provide a fun way to enhance mental abilities and physical capabilities, which can help with communication skills and keeping a strong physical presence.

And then there's the library, which can help out a lot too. You know, it really helps students dive into research, do homework, and get extra work done outside of school. It encourages them to be curious and involved in reading more, plus it boosts their participation in both group work and individual tasks.

So yeah, I believe after-school activities are definitely one of the best ways to help students succeed academically. Another good thing about these activities is that they promote communication skills. They help with time management, too. They motivate students to stay focused and give them extra energy to be more productive, both mentally and physically, when they’re doing these activities.

Lastly, I think after-school activities really build endurance. They bring out a practical side in students, helping them tackle their challenges with studying.

First of all, the self-assistance doesn't have to do a lot of customer service, while technically you still have to do some customer service, but it doesn't require as much as a waitress, and it's more easy to do for cyber-simulites, my friends of course. Although I'm not really keen on this suggestion, due to the fact that it doesn't provide a lot of experience for working with them, and the way was not interesting enough for me to do this job. The second option, turtle, this job requires to be good with children, that's the most important aspect, and you have to be knowledgeable about the subject that you are teaching. Of course, that's the reason why you choose to be a turtle. And not only that, being good at what you're doing is not the most important aspect at all. It has to be the way to teach. The person to do turtle has to be a good teacher, a way to talk and explaining subjects so that the other person can understand it perfectly. They have to make up the way of explaining the topic, easy to understand, and doesn't confuse the listener. The final option is to be a waitress. I think to be a waitress is the hardest job out of the three, because it has so much customer service and so much interaction with other people. It might going to be difficult for people who have social anxiety, but it's a great learning experience to be more socialized. But for my friend, I was suggesting to be a waitress due to the fact that her nature of being silent introverted, so having a job that interacts a lot with other people, might have her on her way to be more socialized.","Okay, so in my personal opinion, the three jobs—self-assistant, tutor, and waitress—are really different from each other, and honestly, picking one just depends on what you prefer. First off, self-assistance, like, doesn’t need a ton of customer service. I mean, sure, there's some customer service involved, but it’s way less than what a waitress has to deal with, and it can be easier for, like, cyber-simulates, I guess you could say, my friends too. But to be honest, I'm not super into that option 'cause it doesn't really give you much experience working with people, and the job isn't interesting enough for me.

Now, moving on to the second option, tutoring. So this job really requires you to be good with kids—that's, like, the most important thing. Plus, you gotta know your stuff, which is why you’d want to be a tutor in the first place. But, you know, being good at the subject isn’t everything. The way you teach is super crucial too. A tutor has to be a really good teacher, right? They need to know how to talk and explain things in a way that makes it easy for the other person to understand. It’s all about making your explanations clear so you don’t confuse the listener.

Lastly, we have being a waitress. Honestly, I think being a waitress is the hardest job out of the three because it involves a ton of customer service and interacting with people all the time. That could be tough for someone with social anxiety, but it’s also a great chance to learn how to be more social. So, for my friend, I actually suggested being a waitress because, you know, she’s pretty quiet and introverted. I thought that having a job where you interact a lot with others might really help her learn to open up more and be more social.",8.0,9.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230048-2.mp3,CD9_1,2

Well if I go in situation I will do I would choose reading history books firstly I can tell you I'm an introvert so I always want to read books alone I don't want to read books with anymore or anything. So the second reason is reading books it help me have a wide knowledge and it also help me unwind before I sleep. So I frequently reading history books in library because it also a place to help me can concentrate on my book and it's also a bit taking place to reading books for me. So firstly I think reading sometimes I also think reading book with someone else it also help me save my knowledge and find different knowledge from different people. However when I feel however reading books sometimes it also help me blow up something. So I thank for listening. you you,"Okay, so my situation is that I have three options: going to the museum, watching documentaries, or reading history books.

I really just like to read books by myself—I don’t wanna read with anyone else or anything like that. 

The second reason is that reading helps me gain a lot of knowledge, and it also helps me unwind before I go to sleep. I often read history books in the library because, you know, it’s a perfect place for me to concentrate on my reading. It’s just a really nice environment for that.

Sometimes I think reading with someone else could also be helpful because I can get different perspectives and knowledge from them.

First, about my company, I am working in a hospital. So between the three options, the communication skills, the professional skills, and being honest, I think the most important one is being honest. The reason I am following is being honest is really important when working in a hospital. When you deal with people directly, you have to explain to the patient about their health, their conditions, about their best treatments. Sometimes in this field, there is no best treatment, but you have to explain to the patient that this treatment can have these benefits and that drawbacks. The other treatments can be somehow likely different. The patient has to choose between those treatments based on the doctor's explanation. So being honest is really important because you cannot try to choose the treatment that will give you the most money. But you have to explain these treatments honestly for the patient to choose for their most benefits. The other tools are also important. The communication skills and professional skills are really important too. They can be trained. For professional skills, I think it is important because the training of the professional skills in the medicine field has to take a long term. If you get a worker that has good professional skills, then that will be better than training them from the staff. The communication skills are also very important. I think these two letters are not as much important.","Okay, so now I wanna talk about what I think is the most important quality to look for when hiring new employees for my company. Just to give you a bit of background, I work in a hospital. So out of the three options we have—communication skills, professional skills, and honesty—I truly believe that being honest is the most crucial one.

You know, the reason I think honesty's so important in a hospital is because you're dealing directly with patients. You really need to explain to them about their health, their conditions, and the best treatments available. Sometimes, there isn’t a clear ""best"" treatment; it's more about presenting the options. You have to let the patients know how each treatment works, what the benefits and drawbacks are, and then they can make informed decisions based on that.

It’s super important to be honest because you can't just push a treatment that’ll make you or the hospital more money. Patients deserve the truth so they can choose what's best for them, you know? 

Now, the other skills like communication and professional skills are really important too, and they can be trained, which is good. For professional skills, especially in medicine, they take a long time to develop. If we can bring someone on board who already has great professional skills, that’s definitely a win compared to training someone from scratch. 

And yeah, communication skills matter a lot as well. But honestly, I think honesty is what really stands out the most in this field.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_2/audio/HUST111223FIAI177/HUST1112230171-2.mp3,CD14_2,2
audio/HUST24223GHH9177/HUST2402230004-2.ogg," All right, so all the three options are kind of artwork. Let's talk about the plan first. The plan is kind of a safe option because, you know, people like our mothers, they like plants, they like taking care of it. They like taking care of everything. We are the great example. So, buying a plant would be, I'm guessing, sufficient as a birthday gift. If you don't know what your mother likes, the plan is a safe choice. And then there's a bottle of perfume. Well, I don't know. Do your mother go out a lot? Like, does she go out to special events that have a lot of people gathering, like an intervention or a convention, something like that? And does your mom like to work in a place that is with a lot of people? Then a bottle of perfume is a really decent choice, I have to say. However, you should be really careful with the scent of the perfume. Because the scent is, I don't know how to say it, it is sensitive, yes. The scent is sensitive to others, especially for your mom. Your mom must be able to take the scent and others must feel comfortable with it. Most importantly to your mother, if she doesn't like the scent, what's the point of buying a bottle of perfume? And then a piece of kitchenware that you can't cook. If your mom doesn't cook, then I recommend you shouldn't buy it. Because a kitchenware is just like a tool that you never use. It is a risky option, pretty risky. But however, if your mom likes to cook and you haven't got that kitchenware, then it would be a perfect choice. But only if your mom likes to cook. So, all in all, I would say the plant is a safe choice. Perfume is a much more preferable choice, but needs a great amount of considerable thought. And a piece of kitchenware is dependent on the taste.","Okay, so, like, all three options are kind of related to artwork, right? But let’s start with the plant. I think that's a pretty safe option, 'cause, you know, most moms like plants. They love taking care of them, just like they take care of everything else in the house. So, buying a plant is, like, a good birthday gift if you’re not really sure what your mom likes. It's kind of a no-fail pick, you know?

Then there’s the bottle of perfume. Um, I don't know, does your mom go out a lot? Like, does she attend special events where a lot of people gather, like maybe a dinner party or a convention? If she does, then a bottle of perfume could be a really nice gift. But you gotta be careful with the scent, you know? Scents can be, I guess, super sensitive for people, especially for your mom. You want to make sure she actually likes it, 'cause there’s no point in buying a perfume if she’s not into the smell.

Alright, and then there’s kitchenware. If your mom doesn’t cook, then, like, don’t get her kitchenware. It’s just gonna be, like, a tool sitting there unused, which is risky, for sure. But, if your mom loves to cook and she could really use that kitchenware, then it’s a great choice. But only if she actually enjoys cooking.

So, to wrap it up, I’d say the plant is the safest option. The perfume could work, but just make sure you really think about it. And the kitchenware, well, it really just depends on whether your mom cooks or not.",9.0,9.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_1/audio/HUST24223GHH9177/HUST2402230004-2.mp3,CD7_1,2
audio/HUST6723H9GJ166/HUST0607230019-3.ogg," Well, about the topic that teenagers should be encouraged to live more independently, I think that firstly it would boost the self-confidence of the teenagers. Why? Because when the teenagers are encouraged to live independently, they will have some sort of self-confidence about themselves. They're confident that they're living independently. They're not dependent on any of their parents or relatives or whatsoever. And so by that, and also they have a chance to be exposed to life better. So that is to fend for themselves so that they could be encouraged to fend for themselves and well, just to be confident about themselves. And next up, too, when living independently, they can decrease the burden on others, which is closely related to this boosting self-confidence that I have talked about earlier. Because they are not financially dependent on their parents and their relatives anymore. So that they can also, they're not currently living with them. So that before living independently, not only others, especially the family and their relatives, have to fend for them, have to give them accommodations and tolerating the financial instability. And now they have a chance to decrease the burden on the others. And next up, they're going to be more responsible to themselves. And finally, I think that that is closely related to the tendency that they are going to be exposed to life earlier. And they have to fend for themselves more. And by fending for themselves, they have to make ends meet at an early age. And by that, they have to prepare a lot for themselves. So I think this makes a circle that by preparing a lot for themselves, they're going to be having a lot of self-confidence. And by having self-confidence, they can confidently say that they have decreased their burden on others. And they have become more responsible for themselves by fending for themselves and making ends meet at an early age. Now what about how have the ways that parents teach their children changed in the past 10 years? And so personally, I think that parents have taught their children to be more independent throughout the years. And by the time of the 18-year-old Mark, where they have been mature enough to go out and fend for themselves, children are mostly encouraged to move out and live independently of themselves. And the second question is that, will teenagers in my country have more opportunities to live independently in the future? Well, I think not in the near future, but definitely in the future. Why? Most of the parents in my country are pretty much still very conservative. And I know some people that still live with their parents until the age of 25, 26, or even 30. And well, I'm not saying if they are financially stable or not. Well, that just might mean they don't want to buy a house and they're saving up for something else. I'm just saying that some people I know are not occupied, they don't have a job, and they're still living in the parents who are old and probably isn't going to be working in the near future. And what other roles are the parents in helping them live more independently? They can encourage the children to live more independently. And firstly, they can help them to prepare for the first step of living independently. Thank you for listening.","Okay, so I wanna talk about why I think teenagers should be encouraged to live more independently. First off, I really believe it would help boost their self-confidence. You know, when teenagers are pushed to be independent, they start to feel confident about themselves. They realize they can take care of things on their own without depending on their parents or relatives or whatever. And that gives them a better chance to experience life, right? They learn to fend for themselves and that’s really important for their confidence.

Next, living independently can also lower the burden on others, which ties back to that whole self-confidence thing I mentioned. When they’re not financially relying on their parents and relatives anymore, it really changes the game. I mean, before they start living on their own, their family has to cover for them, provide accommodations, and deal with financial ups and downs. So, when they become independent, it helps ease that load on their families.

Also, they become more responsible for themselves. By living on their own, they’re gonna have to handle a lot of things earlier, like making ends meet. It kinda creates this cycle, you know? The more they prepare for themselves, the more self-confidence they gain. And with that confidence, they can recognize that they’ve reduced the burden on their loved ones, and also become more responsible by managing their lives and finances.

Now, about how parenting has changed in the last decade. I’d say parents are encouraging their kids to be more independent over the years. By the time kids hit that 18-year-old mark, they’re expected to be mature enough to go out and take care of themselves. 

And then, will teenagers in my country have more chances to live independently in the future? I think, not just yet in the near future, but definitely eventually. The thing is, a lot of parents where I’m from are still pretty conservative. Like, I know some people who live with their parents until they’re 25, 26, or even 30! And, you know, that doesn’t always mean they’re not financially stable. Some might just be saving up for something bigger, like a house. But I also see others who, like, don’t have jobs and still rely on their parents, especially if the parents are getting older and can’t work much longer.

So what can parents do to help their kids live more independently? Well, they can definitely encourage that independence. And, I think it’s key for parents to help them get ready for those first steps into independent living.

I think there are lots of benefits to do volunteer work. First one is doing volunteer work can help me meeting more new friends. I made a lot of new friends when I did this work. Second one is volunteer work can help me to build many soft skills such as people relations and work organizing when I'm doing volunteers. In my country, it is very common to do volunteer work. Mostly, people, especially students in the university will do volunteer work because these activities I believe to help them building many required skills for their later job. Next, I will talk about noises. Yes, I do my noise because I'm a light sleeper. So if there is noise in the night, I cannot sleep. So yes, I do my noise. In my daily life, mostly I come across the noise in the traffic. Yes, I think there are too much noise in the modern societies, because I live in the city and a lot of noise comes from the vehicles such as motorbikes or cars or trains, mostly trains. Also, I think there are some other noise can come across, can come across from people on the neighborhood. Sometimes there will be people fighting. So sometimes I can hear them too.","Okay, so now I'm gonna talk about volunteer work. I did some volunteer work back when I was a student at university, and I really think there are lots of benefits to it. For one thing, doing volunteer work helps you meet new friends. I actually made a ton of new friends when I got involved in this stuff. Another benefit is that volunteer work helps me build a lot of soft skills, like working with people and organizing tasks while I’m volunteering. 

In my country, doing volunteer work is super common, especially for students in university. I believe these activities really help them develop the skills they’ll need later on for their jobs. 

Next, let’s talk about noise. Yeah, I’m pretty sensitive to noise because I’m a light sleeper, so if there’s noise at night, I totally can’t sleep. In my daily life, I mostly deal with noise from traffic. I mean, there’s just way too much noise in modern society! I live in the city, and a lot of it comes from vehicles like motorbikes, cars, and definitely trains. Plus, sometimes you get noise from neighbors, like when people are arguing.

I have to choose a momentary options, a luxury hotels, a home stay and a guest house. For me, a home stay would be the best choice because of the following reasons. Firstly, when you are going to stay at the guest house, you can experience the controls about the countries. You will know about the traditions, how they do, how they live in daily life. You can try the local food in the areas which would be very interesting for a foreigner. The other reason is if you choose a guest house, it will be less expensive. So it will not cost much when you choose to live in a family. All you need is some fee for the food and for the latest day. I think it's Goso chips. It has a reasonable price. I don't choose a luxury hotels and a home stay. As I said, it will be much more expensive. Also, this kind of place will not have the local food or the controls. You can experience in the guest house because everything is like to be changed to suitable for the foreigners. Among the suggestions, I would choose that staying at the guest house would be the best option for my foreign friends. Thank you.","Okay, so my situation is that, like, I'm writing a message to a friend's relative who’s coming to Hanoi, you know, to suggest some places for her to stay. I’ve got a few options in mind: a luxury hotel, a homestay, and a guest house. For me, I think a homestay would be the best choice, and here’s why. 

First off, when you stay at a guest house, you really get to experience the culture of the country. You'll learn about the traditions and how people live their daily lives. Plus, you can try the local food in the area, which I think would be super interesting for someone coming from abroad. 

The other thing is, choosing a guest house tends to be less expensive, which is great. I mean, you won't have to spend a ton of money if you decide to live with a family. Basically, all you need is some cash for food and maybe a small fee for your stay. I think it's pretty reasonable. 

Now, I wouldn't pick a luxury hotel or a homestay, like I mentioned before, because those can be much more expensive. And honestly, those places often won’t have the local food or the real culture that you’d experience in a guest house. They’re kinda set up more for tourists, you know? 

So, out of all these options, I really think staying at a guest house would be the best choice for my foreign friends. Thanks!",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_2/audio/HUST281123C16D167/HUST2811230139-2.mp3,CD17_2,2

It is cost-saving for some poor or middle class. It is time-saving for a lot of people. When you have to learn somewhere, you have to go to the place to place, day to day, and include traffic jams and some accidents. If you study with online, you have a lot of time to rest, take time to go home. It is very time-saving. Online learning is very convenient. It is very beneficial to me because I have a lot of things to do. I am very busy in school and my part-time job. So, traveling to that place is very difficult to me. It is difficult for traditional classroom. It is very beneficial for me to online learning. It will have some disadvantage for online class if I compare it to traditional classroom. When you are learning from Zoom, you cannot understand the teacher's lesson. When you are learning from Zoom, you cannot understand the teacher's lesson. Sometimes you cannot control the teacher if they study or not. Some students just go to Zoom and do their own thing. After COVID-19, online learning is much more developed. We have a long time to quarantine. Everybody looks at home. They don't need to come out. I think that period of time is more developed in the future.","Okay, so I wanna talk about online learning, you know? It’s really beneficial for a lot of learners, mainly because it’s super convenient. First off, it saves money for those who are poor or in the middle class, and, honestly, it’s also a big time saver for many people. Like, when you have to learn in person, you gotta travel to different places every day, right? And then there’s traffic jams and sometimes accidents, which can just make it a hassle. But with online learning, you can relax a bit more 'cause you don’t have to spend all that time getting to and from class. 

For me, online learning is really great because I've got so much going on. I’m busy with school and my part-time job, so it’s tough to travel to a physical classroom. It just makes things easier for me, you know? But, I mean, there are some downsides to online classes, especially when you compare them to traditional classrooms. Like, when you’re on Zoom, sometimes it’s hard to really get what the teacher’s saying. You might miss stuff or not understand everything, and it’s tricky to keep students engaged. I mean, some students just log into Zoom but are really focused on something else entirely.

After COVID-19, online learning really took off, right? We had a long time being quarantined, and everyone was stuck at home anyway, so, I think that whole situation actually helped online learning grow more.

The first thing that pops into my mind is, like, the stress relief that music can bring. You know, music is kinda like a pill for your mental health. It helps you come up with good ideas and just relax when you don't have any lessons or classes going on in school. 

Playing a musical instrument is definitely a good idea, 'cause you can even come up with your own lyrics while playing, like on the guitar or the piano. Next up is managing your time better. I mean, playing an instrument is pretty tough, and it really makes you think about how to schedule your time—like when you need to practice and improve your skills. It also boosts your confidence, 'cause if your friends ask you to play something, you can show them what you’ve learned with the music score or your own instructions.

Now, let's talk about improving connections. Right now, when you're in school, there's a ton of stuff to deal with. If you have, like, live things going on, playing an instrument is really a great idea. For example, if you’re hanging out with friends and you play the guitar, you can bring out some songs and make the whole place a bit more lively. I think that's really cool. 

Teenagers are all about social media these days, right? So, music brings this good mental health boost—kinda like a chill pill to help you unwind and also make new friends. I feel like I’ve got a good three points in my mind about this, but overall, I think playing a musical instrument is definitely a good idea.

Question 1, which place in your area are popular to visitors? I think in my area, the popular place for visitors is actually museums. In Hanoi, there are so many museums that include historical subjects for visitors to visit. 2, can you describe one of the places? I think the most exciting place that I have been to in Hanoi is the historical museum named Womyn Museum. The most exciting place that is actually written in my house is a big museum with great equipment that you can learn more about the history of women, how they fight in old days. 3, what are the benefits of sightseeing? I think going sightseeing have many benefits that could actually have in daily life. First of all, going sightseeing will have you to have more experience in the country. Secondly, going sightseeing will have you realize after long working hours, how you get in life. Last but not least, going sightseeing will create a really good time with the people you go with. If you just go alone, I think it will make a really wonderful memory. 4, what are your favorite flowers? My favorite flower I could mention is rose. How often do you buy it and on what occasions? Actually, I am really keen on flowers so I don't have really special occasions to buy a flower. I often buy flowers once or until two a week. I think I will degrade my house with a full of flowers so that I can feel a really fresh environment in my house. 3, is this flower a pop builder in my country and can be blended? I think rose is popular in every country and that country is not an exception. People will often buy rose for special occasions such as birthday, party. Actually, with rose we can blend it. I think it will grow and have flowers in like 2 or 3 months. That is the end of my video.","Good morning, teacher! I'm really happy to be here for the test. So, let’s jump into question one, which is about going sightseeing. In my area, I think the most popular places for visitors are actually the museums.

Now, for question two, can I describe one of the places? The most exciting place I've been to in Hanoi has to be the Women’s Museum. It’s a really cool museum, you know? It's a big place with great exhibits where you can learn all about the history of women and how they fought in the past.

Well, I’m really into flowers, so I don’t really need a special occasion to buy them. I usually grab flowers about once or twice a week.

I definitely go for an amusement park for some reason. The first important reason why I choose it is because some amusement park contains both water park and museum. In this, nowadays there are some complex amusement park and they can offer every needs of every member in your family who love to swim, they can go to the water park and who enjoy the time looking for some pictures and art at the museum or gallery. They maybe go for it. The other two options are water park and museum. I believe that they also have their own merit. But you know, in my family, my parents can't swim and they also a little bit older than me and my younger brother. So just going to a water park isn't suitable for them. About a museum, actually my brother and me are not a big fan of watching something artistic or just spend time boring in a gallery or some space that's very abstract for us. So amusement park is still my number one choice because we can spend the time of my whole family to get together with some family games. There's various types of games and outdoor activities that whole my family can join and have fun together. And I believe that it is the most ideal options for my family when they want to be bonding and you know have the memorable experience for each other.","Okay, so I’m gonna talk about which outdoor activity I’d choose for my family gathering. I’ve got three options: a water park, an amusement park, or a museum. And honestly, I’d definitely go for the amusement park, for a couple of reasons. 

First off, a lot of amusement parks these days actually have both water parks and museums, you know? So it's kinda cool 'cause they can cater to everyone's needs. If someone in the family wants to swim, they can head over to the water park, and then if someone else wants to look at art or pictures, they can check out a museum or gallery. It's like the perfect combo!

Now, the other two options, the water park and the museum, I mean, they’ve got their own merits for sure. But, you know, my parents can’t really swim, and they’re a bit older than me and my younger brother so just going to a water park wouldn’t really suit them. As for the museum, my brother and I aren’t exactly huge fans of staring at artistic stuff or hanging out in galleries. It feels a bit boring to us, you know?

So, that's why the amusement park is my top choice. We can all spend time together playing family games and enjoying the different rides. There’s just so much fun stuff to do!

In my opinion, talking to his teacher is, like, not a good choice for a few reasons. First off, you know, sometimes teachers can be really strict or not really understanding, and that can make things worse for him. So, I just don’t think it's the right move. 

Plus, I think there’s, like, a personal connection issue there, you know? Teachers can sometimes be seen as authority figures, not really someone you’d wanna open up to easily. And also, I think if he really needs support, talking to someone close like his parents might be a better idea. But, you know, I get that it might not be as quick as going to a teacher. 

However, I really wouldn’t suggest talking to Billy either, ‘cause, like, sometimes that's not a good fit for dealing with issues at school. I just feel like certain situations don’t really call for involving friends in that way. 

So, in short, I really believe he should avoid talking to his teacher. It’s better for him to figure things out through other options, like talking to his parents for real support.

They share new ideas and information. I can learn more from them. I am going to answer the following question. There are some problems when working in a team. I think sometimes it will not focus on people being noisy or crowded. Some people can argue about lessons. Teamwork is a big part of the organization. It helps improve selection. It helps people to be happy when they make new friends. I agree. I agree.","Okay, so there are a bunch of benefits, you know, when teamwork is promoted in the workplace. First off, teamwork can really help build strong relationships. Like, I can make new friends when I’m working in a team. That’s always nice, right? 

Then, teamwork also improves our communication skills. If it’s just one person, that’s not great, you know? But when we’re working together, we can really boost those communication skills. 

Also, teamwork helps me develop my leadership qualities. When I’m part of a team, I get to learn more skills, like leadership, managing the room, and, like, managing my time better, too. 

Finally, teamwork lets us learn a lot from each other. People share new ideas and information, and I can totally soak that up. 

Now, I’m gonna answer the next question. There are some problems when you’re working in a team, though. Sometimes, it can get kinda noisy or crowded, you know? And some folks might argue about stuff. But overall, teamwork is such a big part of any organization. It helps with building connections, and it makes people happy when they get to make new friends.

A book, especially a hard copy book. It's a classroom item which really enhances academic excellence. A book helps to be able to network and communicate. Reading a book enhances skills. Furthermore, it also increases mental abilities or mental productivity like intelligence. So, a book will help my friend to be able to study more and to be able to read more and know more about things and to be able to practically do things which will help him to study abroad. So, I would say a book is the best option for him because it actually helps him to be able to study more, it helps him to be able to be skilled, and it also helps him to encourage more communication. What I would not like to get from him on the other hand is a beauty product because a beauty product is just, it doesn't really help much because it doesn't really bring out the academic and the mental aspect on him. So, beauty products are just physical items which only last on you for several days. But a book will mentally and physically encourage more intelligence and more academic excellence. And it will in a broader way to be able to enhance more communication and more physical activities and also networking. Because reading a book expands your grammar, expands your way of thinking, expands your social life, which is very effective for studying.

That’s why I feel like a book is the best option for him. It’s not just about studying, it’s about being skilled and encouraging better communication too. 

On the flip side, I wouldn’t wanna get him like a beauty product, 'cause honestly, that doesn’t do much for academic or mental growth. Beauty products are just temporary, they’re nice for a bit, but they fade away after a few days. But a book? It really encourages intelligence and fosters academic excellence in a way that lasts. Plus, reading expands your grammar, thinking, and even your social life, which is super effective for studying.

From my point of view, I totally agree with this view because of some following reasons. The first reason is that raising pests can release the stress. When the elderly are raising pests, they can talk with pests and share what they want. Because pests are such human beings, they can know the feelings of the people. So they will do some activities to make your feelings better. The second reason is that raising pests increase social interaction. People can join some groups like Facebook or Instagram to meet some people raising pests. They can chat in the way to raise pests. Finally, the elderly have an exercise partner. When the elderly want to walk in the park or somewhere, they can walk with pests. It is very fun. I see some elderly people can talk with some younger people to raise pests. In conclusion, raising pests is beneficial to the elderly. What pests are popular in my country? The popular pests in my country are dogs. They can protect the house or raise dogs such as human parents. Do you think that the pets are well taken care of in your country? No, I don't think that. Because the dog is being hunted very much. I think people will spend more money on their pests in the future. Just like that.","Okay, so I think it's true that raising pets is really good for elderly people. I totally agree with that for a few reasons. First off, having pets can really help reduce stress. You know, when elderly people take care of pets, they can talk to them and share whatever’s on their mind. Pets kinda understand human feelings, so they often do little things that can lift someone’s mood. 

Then there’s also the social interaction part. Like, people can join groups on Facebook or Instagram, and meet others who are into raising pets too. It’s a great way to chat and share tips about pet care. 

And let’s not forget about exercise! Pets can be great walking buddies. When elderly folks wanna go for a walk in the park, they can bring their pets along, which makes it really fun. I’ve seen some older people even strike up conversations with younger people while out walking their pets.

So, in conclusion, raising pets really does bring a lot of benefits for elderly folks. As for popular pets in my country, dogs are definitely at the top of the list. They not only protect the house but also feel like family members to the owners. 

But do I think pets are well taken care of in my country? Honestly, no, I don’t think so. There are still issues like dog hunting happening quite a bit.

I have two meals a day, I usually skip breakfast and I just have lunch or dinner, but sometimes in the rush days I just have lunch and then I'll skip dinner as well, which is not healthy I believe, but with the rush life right now that we all have, it's kind of a luxury to have completely three meals a day at the exact same time that you have to make it a routine.

If you are a leader of a group, then you will learn how to be a leader, how to control your teammates, and how to operate as a team. Group work can also promote cooperation. If you work as a team, you will have a better interaction with your teammates. That's when you will learn. For example, going on camping, you will learn how to build a tent with other teammates. Also, group work has more interaction with other students because you can be able to connect with other people in your group. Which helps you a lot in terms of working with other groups in the future as well as going on to have a job. Last but not least is to help with your social interaction. Since your group work is the best way to be able to help you with social interaction because there are many people with different personalities. And you will be able to know how and when to communicate and to treat them as if it was your own. So, about the questions. A good team leader, I believe, has to have a skill to control your teammates, to operate your team, to work the way they want, and to encourage the teammates to be able to complete the task. Which is all the qualities there is to make a team leader. If you have uncooperative members in your team, well firstly, I think you should convince them in order to make them be cooperative with you again. If not, then you can fire them and take another member at that place in the state. Group work deprives one of his or her identity. I believe that view is not the view it should be. Group work doesn't deprive the identity. Group work mixes the identity together and turns them into a complete picture. Which is why I think group work doesn't deprive one of his or her identity. That's all. Thank you. .","Okay, so I think group work should really be encouraged, you know, for scoring. Why? Because it helps you build leadership skills. If you’re the leader of a group, then you’re gonna learn how to lead, how to manage your teammates, and how to work well as a team. And also, group work really promotes cooperation. When you’re working as a team, there’s gonna be way better interaction with your teammates, and that’s when the real learning happens.

For example, like if you go camping, you’ll learn how to set up a tent with your group. Plus, group work gets you to interact with other students, which is super helpful, right? You get to connect with different people in your group, and this helps you a lot for working with other groups in the future, and even when you get a job later on. 

And of course, one more thing is that it really helps with your social skills. Group work is one of the best ways to improve your social interaction because you're dealing with a bunch of people who have different personalities. You’ll learn how and when to communicate and treat them well, like they were your own friends or something.

Like you gotta be able to control your teammates, operate the team, work the way they want, and encourage them to complete the task. Those are really the qualities that make a good team leader. 

And if you’ve got uncooperative teammates, I think the first thing you should do is try to convince them to work with you again. But if that doesn’t work, maybe you have to let them go and find someone else to take their place. 

Now, about this idea that group work takes away someone's identity, I really don’t agree with that. I think group work actually mixes identities together and creates a complete picture, you know? So that's why I believe it doesn't take away from anyone’s identity.

There are three options, a book, a game console and a diary. Which gift do you think is the best choice? Personally, I would say that giving your friend a diary would be the best choice. Secondly, I would say the book if you don't decide on the diary. And then lastly, the game console. Alright, so the diary first, because that way they can, everyday they can write in the diary what they experienced, how they felt during that day, what happened. That way they can document their whole military service tour depending on where they go and what they do. I would think that is a very good gift to give to a friend. Just so they have a documentation of what they did day by day or however they want to do it week by week. And that way when they come home to visit friends and family they can share what they experienced everyday or every week, every month depending on how they decide to use the diary. But I personally would think that the diary is an exceptional choice. Secondly, I would say a book because a book, depending on what book it is, hopefully it is a nice thick book with a lot of reading material in it. That way your friend can stay busy or read a book and then they can go to the book just to escape the reality of what they are dealing with at the moment. So yeah, depending on the book, but you would have to know your friend very very well in order to know what kind of a book to get them. And also you would need to know if they do read books, like not a lot of people like to read. So yeah, you would have to do a little bit of research and make sure that you get the correct book for your friend. And a game console would be my last option. Depending on where they are, they might not even be electricity or they don't have time. I mean they are going to a military service. So I don't think even game consoles are allowed in the military. So depending, I would not recommend buying a game console. They would not have time and it is not allowed to have a gaming console in the military. So my option would definitely be the diary. I think it is a very very good selection. That way they can...","Alright, so, the question is, you're gonna buy a gift for a friend who's heading to military service. Just a little error there in the sentence, but whatever. So, there are three options: a book, a game console, and a diary. Honestly, I think the best choice would be the diary. If you don't go for the diary, then I’d say a book, and the game console would be my last pick.

So, starting with the diary, I think it's perfect because your friend can write every day about what they experienced, how they felt, and what happened. You know, it’s a great way for them to document their whole military service, depending on where they go and what they do. I mean, I really think it’s a thoughtful gift so they can keep track of everything day by day, or even week by week if they prefer. Then, when they come home to see friends and family, they can share all those experiences from their time away. So, yeah, I really believe the diary is an exceptional choice.

Now, the second option I would pick is the book. So, if you choose a book, hopefully, it’s a nice thick one with a lot of reading material. That way, your friend can keep busy or just escape reality for a bit through reading. But, you know, it depends on the book. You'd really need to know your friend well, like what kinds of books they like, and if they're actually into reading. Not everyone is a big reader, so that’s something to think about.

And then, the game console, I mean, that would be my last option. Depending on where they are stationed, they might not even have electricity or, like, time to play games. I think having a game console in military service is probably not allowed, honestly. So, yeah, I really wouldn’t recommend buying a game console at all.

But raising pets have so many benefits to the elderly. First is to relieve stress. You know, there's a report have been shown that the sound of a cat can calm a person and can help people feel more comfortable. So elderly because they don't have much time with their children because their children are kind of busy to visit them more frequently. So a pet is like a friend to them who always be there for them and listening to their old story without judging them. And they only listen and they always be there for them to pet. A touch with a pet can help elderly people feel comfortable. And the second benefit is they can have the elderly to increase their social interaction. Especially for the elderly who is the kind of introvert person. Having a pet can help them to have a common topic with the other person by talking about the pet that they have. And it would be a good start for them to break the ice and talk with the other person. And the third benefit is they won't have a partner to do exercise with. Because doing exercise is kind of hard for some elderly people because they find it boring. But with the help from the partner like a dog or a cat, even a yoga exercise is more interesting. So they may have more enthusiastic with doing exercise and that would help them to improve their health. Moreover, raising a pet can have a different benefit. For example, it would give them the sense of presence. Because now if their children are too busy and they don't want to be around them, they will easily feel that no one needs them. But a pet, they are like a child that needs their nurturing and they will feel important to at least someone like their pet. So my following up question now. First, the kind of pets that are popular in my country, they are dogs and cats, sometimes birds. Those are domestic animals that people usually raise indoors. And the second question, I think pets are somehow well taken in my country, especially in families that have children. Because they love pets and they take care of them very well, like their friends. And the third question, I think people may spend more money on their pets in the future because it's their friend. So why don't you spend money on them?","Okay, so this is the third part of my speaking test. And my topic is about how raising pets is beneficial for the elderly. You know, there are really a lot of benefits when it comes to having pets for older people. First, they can help relieve stress. Like, there’s been reports that show the sound of a cat can actually calm someone down and make them feel more comfortable. A lot of elderly folks don’t get to spend much time with their kids 'cause, you know, their kids are super busy and don’t visit as often. So, having a pet can be like having a friend who’s always there, listening to their stories without judging them. And just touching or petting an animal can really help them feel more relaxed.

Next, pets can increase social interaction for the elderly, especially for those who are more introverted. Having a pet gives them something to talk about, like a common topic, which can really help break the ice and make it easier to chat with others. 

Also, pets can be great partners for exercising. I mean, for some elderly people, working out can be kind of boring. But if they have a dog or even a cat with them, it makes it more fun. Like, even doing yoga becomes more interesting because they have their furry friend there, so it can motivate them to get moving and improve their health.

Plus, raising a pet gives them a sense of presence. When their kids are too busy and can’t be around, they might feel like no one needs them. But pets need care and nurturing, which makes them feel important to at least someone, you know, like their pet.

Now, moving on to my follow-up questions. The kind of pets that are popular in my country are mainly dogs and cats, and sometimes even birds. Those are the domestic animals that people usually keep indoors. 

As for the second question, I think pets are pretty well taken care of in my country, especially in families with kids. Kids love pets and usually treat them really well, almost like their little friends. 

And for the third question, I believe people will probably spend more money on their pets in the future because, you know, they see them as friends.

Oh first my favorite color when I prefer using red when I'm decorating my homes because around my home, red symbolizes the luckiness of the professors and the wealth. In my country, a lot of people prefer using red when they're decorating their homes. Do people in my country like red-greening their homes? I think it depends on where they live and their living conditions. As far as I'm concerned, a lot of rich people in my country prefer to redecorate their homes based on certain topics and certain festivals. For example, right now we are immersing in the atmosphere of Christmas and everyone around me, a lot of my friends, they try to put a lot of Christmas-type ornaments in their house like Christmas tree, sprinkles, stars, stockings, and so on. About the trend of decorating new homes for this year, frankly I'm not really interested in decorating new homes so I don't really update about the trends. I once saw one of my friends's Instagram stories and he shared his new home that had been decorated and it kind of made a minimalism with basic painting and with the lighting and the panel used light panel color.","Okay, so first off, my favorite color is red, and I love using it when I’m decorating my home.

As for the richer folks, they tend to redecorate their homes depending on themes or festivals. Like right now, we're in the Christmas vibe, and I’ve noticed that a lot of my friends are putting up Christmas decorations, you know, like Christmas trees, tinsel, stars, stockings, and all that.

Now, talking about current trends for decorating new homes—honestly, I’m not really that into it, so I haven’t kept up with what’s in style. But I did see my friend's Instagram story where he showed off his newly decorated place. He went with a minimalist style, just kept it simple with some basic paint and cool lighting. It looked really nice, but again, I’m not super updated on the latest decorating trends.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_2/audio/HUST111223FIAI167/HUST1112230138-1.mp3,CD14_2,1

There are some benefits that the internet brings to our life. The very first one is the easy access to information. In this era of technology, you just need a computer or a smartphone with a low cost to access the information on the internet. If you don't have your computer or smartphone at home, you can go to the library, school or workplace. I think it's easier for you to use the computer at your workplace or at school to get what you want on the internet. The second advantage is that you can gain a lot of benefits from the internet. The second advantage is that it offers you a variety of information. For example, in 30 seconds, you can search for millions of information on Google and they are all free. This is the time of information on the internet. There are a lot of information on the internet about many fields. That's the reason why you can have a wide range of information. The last benefit is the low cost. Actually, it takes you from 100,000 to 200,000 Vietnam Dongs a month to get the internet at home. I think it's affordable to most people in Vietnam. Even people living in rural areas. In front of the person, the internet plays an important role in our lives. It's great if you can use the internet to help you with your work and your studies. Another question is, what do teenagers in your area usually use the internet for? I think that my teenagers in my area usually use the internet for playing games. Because we know that they are not old enough to distinguish which one is good and which one is bad on the internet. They just love some interesting things on the internet. Something that they feel curious about. The second question, I think every school shouldn't provide internet connection for students. Because they will be distracted from internet connection. Students often bring mobile phones to school. If they don't pay attention to teachers in class, they will use internet connection.","Okay, so let's talk about the internet in today's world, right? I mean, honestly, we can’t really live without it now. There are so many benefits that the internet brings to our lives. The first one is just how easy it is to access information. Like, in this tech-savvy age, all you need is a computer or a smartphone, and they don’t even have to be super expensive. If you don’t have one at home, you can always just go to a library, school, or your workplace. It’s usually easier to use a computer there to look up what you need.

Then, the second advantage is that the internet gives you such a variety of information. I mean, in like 30 seconds, you can find millions of things on Google, and it’s all free! Seriously, this is really the age of information. There’s just so much out there about so many different fields, which is awesome because it gives you a wide range of stuff to learn about.

And about the cost, it’s pretty cheap too. I think, like, you can get internet at home for around 100,000 to 200,000 Vietnam Dongs a month, which is affordable for most folks here, even in rural areas. So, really, the internet plays a huge role in our lives. It’s super helpful for work and studies.

Now, onto the question of what teenagers in my area usually use the internet for... I think they mainly use it for playing games. You know how it is—they’re young and sometimes they can't really tell what’s good or bad online. They just get drawn to fun stuff that catches their curiosity.

And, like, when it comes to schools providing internet access for students, I honestly think they shouldn’t. It can be really distracting. I mean, kids often bring their phones to school, and let's be real, if they get bored in class, they might just start using the internet instead of paying attention to the teachers. So yeah, that’s my take on it!",9.0,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_1/audio/HUST6923V6BY166/HUST0609230002-3.mp3,CD13_1,3
audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230026-2.ogg," For this situation that a primary school asking for parents opinion how to assess students, in my opinion, my option is just commence only for the two main reasons. The first reason is I think the person who had the responsibility and it's the best option to assess a student is their teachers and of course their school supervisors structure because they are who teach the student, listen to the student, along when students spend time in schools so they know how to assess them in the best way. Moreover, the teachers and their school supervisors are well qualified people in education institutions so they will be better to assess students. About the student's parents, they should have some space for a comment and contribute to the student's assessment because the student, their parents, they know about their children and they also have the responsibility to watch and to care about their student's scores or their study situation so they should have some comments and this has both positive effects on the student assessment. First, their comments will contribute and can be suggestions for the teachers when they assess the students and second, their comments will help their children to know that in their parents' opinion what they should do and focus on.","Okay, so I wanna talk about this situation where a primary school is asking for parents’ opinions on how to assess students. And honestly, I think the best approach is to keep it simple and stick to just two main reasons. 

So the first reason is that I believe the people who are responsible for assessing students should really be their teachers, along with school supervisors. I mean, these folks are the ones who teach the students and spend the most time with them at school. They really know how to assess them in the best way possible. Plus, teachers and supervisors are trained and qualified, so they have the expertise needed for this.

Now, about the students’ parents, I think they definitely should have a chance to share their thoughts and contribute to the assessment process. Parents know their kids really well, and they’re responsible for watching over their academic progress. So, having their comments can actually be pretty beneficial. 

First, their feedback can give teachers some useful insights when they’re assessing students. And second, it helps the kids understand what their parents think they should focus on. I mean, it’s a two-way street, right? So, overall, I think a mix of teacher assessments and parent input can really help make the whole process better for everyone involved.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC166/HUST0405230026-2.mp3,CD9_1,2

So in my opinion, I'm not personally, I do not travel very much so I do not have much experience in choosing the type of accommodation but as far as I know, Homestay is a pretty good choice. It is private and beautiful at the... You and your friends can have a private and comfortable time at a homestay because it is separated and it's just like your house with all the available furniture and stuff but if you want to save money on accommodation, to spend more on food or other things, you can choose a hotel. It still has enough stuff while providing you with a place to rest after you're going out and for self-coupling flat, I think this can be a good choice if you have a lot of money so in my opinion, I think I will choose a homestay because it is affordable, private and comfortable.","Okay, so first off, I think Da Nang is just a really beautiful city in Vietnam, and the trip there is gonna be awesome, like, really great! I mean, personally, I don’t travel a whole lot, so I don’t have tons of experience in picking out places to stay. But, from what I know, a homestay is actually a pretty good option. It's private and nice, you know? You and your friends can enjoy some comfortable time together at a homestay since it kinda feels like your own place—like, you get all the furniture and stuff you need.

But, if you're looking to save some cash on where you stay, so you can spend more on food or other fun stuff, then a hotel might work too. Hotels usually have all the basics, plus you still have a spot to crash after you’ve been out and about. Now, for a self-catering flat, I think that could be a good choice too, but I guess you’d need to have a decent budget for that, right?

In the first place, it's a river that a teacher helps you to join more knowledge, join more listening, broaden your origin and perspective about your subject's duties and help you to become more responsible and independent in your life. Therefore, they are the reasons why I agree with this solution. As for the other options, I have some reservations. I am not in favor of a shopping assistant because this year is very hard for me because I am facing the stress of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the way it's true is very interesting but I do not support this solution because my parents don't allow me to do this job. So because it's very hard and I don't have time to take care of myself and don't have to concentrate on their study. To sum up, I don't agree with this solution.

First off, it helps you gain so much knowledge, right? It helps you listen better, and it can really widen your perspective on your studies, which is super important, and it can also teach you to be more responsible and independent in life. So, yeah, those are the reasons why I totally agree with going for a tutor.

Now, about the other options, I have some doubts. Like, I'm not really on board with the shopping assistant job. Honestly, this year’s been pretty tough for me, you know, dealing with the stress from my cardiovascular issues. So, while being a shopping assistant might sound interesting, I can't really support that option because my parents just wouldn’t let me do it.

In my opinion, I will choose a homestay. I think it's a bad choice for me and my family. When we choose a homestay for my trip, I can save a lot of money because when we live in a resort or hotel, we need to pay the money for the service and for a lot of service in the hotel or in the resort. But when we live in the homestay, we can do everything with the people who live in their house. We can save a lot of money to buy the gift for my friends after the trip. It's very good for my relationship with my friends when I buy gifts for them. Secondly, I can know more knowledge about this place I go to travel. I think it's a good way to talk with the people who live in the place. When we talk with the people who live in the place, we can ask about the Chinese culture in that place. In some famous places, I can go to travel and take photos. Secondly, we can work with them and know about their life and the people in that place. I think I can eat the Chinese food easily in their house because they have a lot of time to live in there. They know what is the best food and they can cook for me.","Okay, so I wanna share my opinion on this.

When we choose a homestay, we actually save a lot of money. You know, at a resort or hotel, we're paying for all these extra services and stuff, but staying with a family in a homestay lets us get to know the local people and their lives. And with the money we save, I can buy gifts for my friends after the trip, which is super nice and helps me keep good relationships with them. 

Also, another great thing is that I get to learn more about the place we're visiting. It's such a cool way to chat with the locals and ask about the culture in that area. Plus, there are usually some famous spots we can visit and get awesome photos. You know, we can even work with them sometimes and really get a sense of their daily lives.

So, first off, there are just so many good qualities that a teacher can have. I mean, the first thing I'd mention is their teaching methods, you know? That's really important. Then, another thing is how a good teacher interacts with their students, or, like, the kids in class. It’s all about that connection they make. 

Because, honestly, if a teacher doesn’t know how to manage the class or be friendly with the students, it’s just gonna be chaos in there. And, like, that's definitely not what you want. It can really affect the school and a lot of kids too. 

So, yeah, the teaching method is really important. Why do I say that? Well, as a teacher, you need to know what method you're gonna use to teach. You might use the basic approach or even create your own method. But, you know, whatever method you choose, it should be easy and helpful for the students and the school. 

A good teacher can really change a student's life, right? Like, if you're a good teacher, you can make a big impact by making sure that students can follow along with activities, you know, like classwork and even things like motor skills and sensory activities. And games can be a fun part of learning too—like teaching them new vocabularies and all that. 

So if you're an intelligent teacher, I believe that, like, intelligent and good kids will follow. But then, there's this thought I have about whether teachers can be replaced by computers in the future. I mean, think about it—the world is evolving. Even dogs are using gadgets now, and their owners help them communicate using tech, which is pretty wild! 

So, I can see a future where, maybe, computers might take on the teaching role. It’s an interesting idea to think about, but for now, let’s just appreciate the good teachers we have! ",8.5,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M166/HUST0310230211-3.mp3,CD15_3,3

During my service, some of the customers didn't pay attention and they bumped into me as I was going up. I lost my balance, fell down and hit the glass door and actually broke it. Somehow I walked away with only a minor injury if you scratch to my hand. Fortunately, the manager also saw the accident on the camera and decided not to find me with the breaking of the glass. If I saw a traffic accident, I think I will help the victim. If that is a serious accident, I will have to call the ambulance and talk to the doctor before I try to do something. If I do something wrong, it could actually worse the patient. Like dislocate their spine or something like that. After that, I will also have to call the police to notify them about the accident. Wait for them to arrive and make sure the patient either get up and get away safely or at least get to the ambulance before continuing doing my work. About my personality, it makes me happy. Football, simple as that. I like to play football, I love watching it. It is my favorite sport. I don't worry about a lot of stuff. I guess if anything is only about my parents' health. Because they are getting older and older and I still not able to help them. I don't know.","Okay, so I wanna share a work-related accident I had once. It was when I was a waiter at a coffee store, and, you know, things got a little crazy. So, I was serving some customers, and they weren't really paying attention, right? They bumped into me while I was on my way up, and I ended up losing my balance and falling—yeah, it was pretty bad. I hit this glass door and actually broke it. But somehow, I got lucky and walked away with just a little scratch on my hand. The good thing was, the manager saw the whole thing on the camera and decided not to blame me for breaking the glass.

Now, if I were to witness a traffic accident, I think I'd definitely wanna help the victim. If it looked serious, I’d call an ambulance right away, talk to the doctor, and stuff like that before trying to do anything. I mean, if I did something wrong, it could make the situation worse—like, dislocating their spine or something, you know?

I’d make sure the person gets up safely or at least into the ambulance before going back to what I was doing.

I try not to worry about too much stuff, you know?

audio/HUST24223GHH9167/HUST2402230066-2.ogg," So this is the part 2 of my speaking test. My situation is that my friend is planning to buy his mother a birthday gift. So there are three options suggested. A plant, a border, a perfume and a piece of kitchenware. So I think among these three options, a piece of kitchenware is the best choice. It is because his mom loves cooking so it is easier to detect what kind of kitchenware that she likes. For example, as I know that his mother loves to make milk and yogurt so it is easier to buy a machine that helps her to cook milk. For example, almond milk or corn milk. It will save her time and I think she will love it because it is useful. For the other options about plants, raising a plant is quite difficult because it will need more effort than cooking because it will require sunshine or the right amount of water every day or humidity and other conditions to raise the plant. You know that if you give a person a plant as a gift and a plant is dead, it is kind of bad luck. Everyone wants a healthy plant and they will spend a lot of effort on it. So it will cost a lot of time for her especially when she has three children as I know because he has another two young twins brother. So it will cost her time. For the other option is a bottle of perfume. You know that women love perfume but because there are a lot of flavors and orders of different types of brands. So it is hard to know what kind of smell and order that she likes because the price of perfume is quite high and if he chooses a perfume that she doesn't like, it won't be a waste of money. So I think it is not a good idea to buy perfume. So among them, a piece of kitchenware like a cooking machine is the best choice. So this is the end of my second part.","Okay, so this is part two of my speaking test. So my situation is, my friend is trying to find a birthday gift for his mom, right? And he has three options: a plant, a bottle of perfume, and a piece of kitchenware. I think out of these three, the kitchenware is the best choice. 

The reason for that is, you know, his mom really loves cooking, so it's kinda easy to figure out what kitchenware she’d like. Like, I know she enjoys making milk and yogurt, so he could get her one of those machines that help with that, like for almond milk or corn milk. That would save her a lot of time, and I really think she'd appreciate it since it’s super useful.

Now, when it comes to the plant option, raising a plant can be pretty tricky, you know? It takes a lot of effort, more than cooking does, actually. Plants need sunlight, the right amount of water every day, humidity—all these conditions to thrive. And, I mean, if you give someone a plant and it dies, that's like bad luck, right? I think most people want a healthy plant, and taking care of it takes a lot of time, especially since his mom has three kids, including two young twin brothers. That’s a lot on her plate!

Then there's the perfume option. Sure, women like perfume, but there are just so many scents and brands out there. It's kinda hard to know what her favorite smell is. Plus, perfumes can be pretty pricey, and if he picks one that she doesn't like, that’s just a waste of money, you know? So overall, I really think the kitchenware, like the cooking machine, is the best choice.

audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230274-3.ogg," Yes, university education is beneficial for students in a number of ways and I really agree with this. We have many reasons for explaining why university education is more beneficial to learners. Most of all, it provides academic knowledge and the teacher, the lecturer who works at university, almost has a professional or master degree so they are one of the professional or experts at university so they are easy to convey the knowledge and theory to their students and they are easy to reach high-guess knowledge. The second reason is when the students study at university, they can have more occupation opportunities and in my country, they are highly appreciative with the valuation degree which comes from the reputest educational system and we have many options and have many opportunities for them and when they are studying at university education, they can promote the social skills. The reason why I say that is because when you study in there, they have a connection with others who are at the same level and who are trained in the professional way and they can provide knowledge about the presentation skills or skills like writing or communicating with others or understanding someone and actually I think it's more beneficial. In my opinion, when I am studying at university system, I think I am easy to choose my job when I graduate and actually it provides me a basic requirement when I want to apply the higher position in the company after I graduate. Yes, that's the reason why I think university system is more beneficial to students in a number of ways and in myself, I think university education is also providing me with my knowledge and providing my theories.","Okay, so I totally think that university education is super beneficial for students, and I really agree with that. There are a bunch of reasons why I think university education can be more helpful for learners. First off, it gives you academic knowledge, and like, the teachers or lecturers at universities usually have professional or master's degrees. So, they're like experts in their fields, and that makes it easier for them to share their knowledge and theories with the students, right? 

The second reason is that when students are in university, they have more job opportunities. In my country, people really value a degree from a good educational system, and that opens up a lot of doors for them. Plus, while they’re studying, they also get to work on their social skills. What I mean by that is, when you're in university, you connect with other students who are learning the same things and who are trained professionally. It’s a great chance to pick up skills like presentation, writing, and even communicating with others. So yeah, that's definitely beneficial.

For me personally, when I was studying at university, I found it way easier to choose a job after I graduated. It really sets me up with a strong foundation, like, meeting the basic requirements for higher positions in a company once I’m done with school. So, overall, I think the university system offers a lot of benefits for students, and I've definitely gained a lot of knowledge and theories from it.",8.5,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230274-3.mp3,CD16_3,3
audio/HUST311023JNFX167/HUST3110230040-3.ogg," In part 3, my topic is Afterschool activities are beneficial for students. And I will discuss about this idea. The afterschool activities must have activities for the students. But only students will need to join it because the first thing is to increase the communication skills of the students. They have to communicate with their friends, their teachers, or their coach to finish the activity. So the working group skills will be increased and they can feel comfortable when communicating with the stranger. In the second part, when they join the afterschool activities, they can manage the time to finish the activity and finish the schooling lesson and homework. And the third part is networking. And it's networking because when they join the afterschool activities, they can make friends with a lot of people. The other schools can find the quotes when they join the sport activities or when the other activities can increase their talent on the app or they can discover the hidden talent. So I think the afterschool activities are very needed for the students. Some common HR activities students need are spotlight streaming, camping, checking, playing football, or another sport. They can make a group to discover the new skill of the new designer or designer or making a band or something like that. I think the HR activities will make you feel sorry for the students, but it's not a lot because the most important goal of the students is studying. And the result of studying will be that even they have spent too much time for the activity. So basically in my conclusion, I think activities afterschool is very good and we must watch the students to join it.","Okay, so in part three, I wanna talk about how afterschool activities are really beneficial for students, right? So, afterschool activities should definitely be there for the students, but, you know, it’s up to them if they wanna join or not. I mean, the first thing is that these activities really help boost their communication skills. They have to talk to their friends, their teachers, or their coaches to get things done, which is great. So, their teamwork skills get better and they also feel more comfortable chatting with new people, which is awesome.

Then, the second point is about time management. When they get involved in these afterschool activities, they learn how to juggle their time to finish their schoolwork and homework along with everything else. It’s a good way for them to manage their responsibilities.

And then, there's the networking aspect. You know, by joining these activities, they get to meet lots of new people. Like, when they participate in sports or other kinds of activities, they can make friends not only from their own school but also from other schools. Plus, they can discover their hidden talents or even new interests.

So, I really think these afterschool activities are super important for students. You can think of common activities like spotlight streaming, camping, or, like, playing football and other sports. They can form groups to explore new skills, like maybe becoming a designer or even starting a band. That sort of teamwork can be really fun.

Now, I know some people might feel like these activities could take away from study time, but honestly, I think it’s not really that big of a deal. The main goal for students is to learn, right? And the benefits they get from these activities, like communication and time management, are really valuable in the long run.

So, basically, in conclusion, I believe afterschool activities are really good for students, and we should encourage them to be a part of it.",8.0,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_1/audio/HUST311023JNFX167/HUST3110230040-3.mp3,CD16_1,3

I wouldn't organize a party so I would definitely not advise you taking this option. organizing a party and inviting your teachers and classmates to have a party together especially if there is going to be alcohol together does not sound like a very good choice. so in my opinion I would definitely say that organizing a party is not the way to go. holding a one day trip. if you are thinking of having a one day trip depending on where it is and also if there is no teachers available you must think about that. I would say don't invite teachers just make sure that you invite everyone that has graduated with you. so it is only your peers that are with you if you are going to have a one day trip. so in my opinion I would say that planning a one day trip will be your best option. that way you can interact and bond with your peers again. catch up on the years that you guys have missed together when you grew apart and it can be a fun family day trip. in 10 years like I said a lot can change. your peers or friends will have families so you can have a one day trip that is family friendly with loads of different activities for you, your friends or your peers and also for the children. so that is why I would say pick a one day trip.","Okay, so you're thinking about three options, right? Like, visiting your old school and teachers, organizing a party with teachers and classmates, or having a one-day trip. So, which one do I think is the best choice? 

Well, visiting your old school and teachers could be cool, but honestly, it really depends on whether the school and teachers are available. You know, a lot can change in ten years, so I’m not completely sold on that option. 

Then, there's organizing a party and inviting teachers and classmates. Personally, I wouldn't go for that, so I'd definitely not recommend it. I mean, having a party and including teachers, especially if there's gonna be alcohol involved, just doesn’t sound like a great idea to me. So yeah, I think organizing a party is not the way to do it. 

Now, if you're thinking about a one-day trip, that could be a fun option! Just keep in mind the location and, like, whether teachers can join or not. I'd say skip the teachers and just invite everyone who graduated with you. You want it to be a day for your peers, right? 

So, in my opinion, planning a one-day trip is probably your best bet. It’ll give you a chance to reconnect, catch up on all those years when you guys kinda drifted apart, and just have some fun together. And, like I said, a lot can change in ten years—your friends might have families now, so you could make it a family-friendly day with loads of activities for everyone, including the kids. So, yeah, I’d say go with a one-day trip!",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_2/audio/HUST6923DQQK166/HUST0609230115-2.mp3,CD13_2,2

Well, in my opinion, I would gravitate towards a team building day as the most ideal choice among three options if I were in this situation, on account of several reasons as follows. In the first place, I think a team building day can offer a quality time for colleagues and bosses, especially for the women in the company, to alleviate stress after nerve-wracking working hours. It's a good chance for them to meet their childers, to share everything, and it's definitely advantageous for them to build more relationships and develop their communication skills. On top of that, I think when offering a team building day, the bosses can pay some benefits, some financial benefits to the women who dedicated for a long time for the company, and they can have a chance to pay visit to other places, which you have to enjoy the beautiful, the spectacular landscapes, and they can feel peace of mind and recharge their batteries after work before coming back to work, because that is her day. In terms of two options remaining, I will explain some reasons why I reject them. So first of all, I think talent shows and buffet at restaurants, they can always be held in a team building day at night, you can burn a fire and people can dance together and enjoy some local food if you travel to the mountainous area.","Okay, so I’m really into the idea of a team building day, which I think is the best choice out of the three options we have—like, the talent show and the buffet at the restaurant too. But if I were in this situation, I’d totally pick the team building day for a couple of reasons.

First off, I believe a team building day can really provide quality time for all the colleagues and bosses, especially the women in the company. It's a great way for them to unwind after a really stressful work week, you know? Plus, it's a chance to meet each other's families and share experiences, which can really help build stronger relationships and sharpen their communication skills.

On top of that, during a team building day, the bosses can offer some benefits or financial rewards for those employees who’ve been with the company for a long time. They can visit new places and enjoy the beautiful landscapes, which is so refreshing and gives them a chance to recharge before getting back to work. I mean, it’s like their special day!

Now, as for the other two options, I’ve got my reasons for not choosing them. I think talent shows and buffets at restaurants can actually be included as part of the team building day. Like, you could have a bonfire at night, where everyone can dance and enjoy some local food if they travel to a beautiful mountainous area. So, yeah, that’s why I’m all for the team building day!",8.0,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_3/audio/HUST44237SIU167/HUST0404230263-2.mp3,CD8_3,2

I really like football ‘cause, um, it's just one of those activities that keeps you healthy and fit, you know? It’s super energetic and gives you a lot of energy, which really helps you train harder when you're playing. 

I’d say football is the most popular sport in my country, especially among young people, like those under 25. You know, it helps boost their metabolism and keeps them in good shape, health-wise. 

Now, about my neighbors — I think I have a good relationship with them. They just moved in about a month ago, and they're really friendly people.

So, it’s super crucial for me to, like, volunteer and visit the countryside.

But honestly, I still think the best choice is to actually go into the countryside myself. There are so many things I could learn and, you know, I’d be able to talk to the people living there, which would give me more insights for my project.

And I feel like it would be really beneficial if I could stay there for a couple of weeks, like really soak in the experience, you know? That way, I can write from my own perspective, which would make the project a lot better. 

So, I’ve had some experience with this before. I did a vlog for school about a trip I took to Da Nang. And honestly, it was amazing!

So the reason why the notebooks and pencils are out of the way, the acting of giving them some money or old clothes, is that I believe that the children want to go to school, however, maybe they don't have a chance, they have a chance to buy all of the accessories like the notebooks or the pencils. So I believe that this is a good gift or a good thing to give them. When you talk about the money, why I don't choose money is because even when I give them the money, however, this is the mountainous area, so they cannot use the money to buy even the clothes or the food or the things they want. So for the next thing is the clothes. For me, if I want to give the clothes, for example, my clothes are not suitable for them, so it's really hard for not me, but some of my friends or other people, maybe it's hard to give the clothes to the children because maybe it's not appropriate for them. So yes, my experience with this one is not open to pencils. So one last thing is I believe that the North Vietnam children should have more chance to go to school, and this way they can give more of their knowledge and maybe give them the right opportunity in the future, in the current future. And it is the fact that in this mountainous area, some parents, for them to stay at home and not allow them to go to school. So besides from giving the notebook and pencil, if I have a chance to go to the mountainous areas, I will try to persuade the parents and tell them the benefits of going to school and tell them to give their children to school, like instead of staying at home and doing some housework or working for the money.","Okay, so, for my perfect gift, if I got the chance to take part in a charity event to help children in the mountainous areas, I would choose to give them some notebooks and pencils. The reason I picked notebooks and pencils instead of just giving money or old clothes is that I really believe these kids want to go to school, but they might not have the chance to get all the things they need, like notebooks and pencils. So, I think this would be a good gift for them, you know?

Now, talking about money, I didn’t choose that because, even if I gave them money, it’s a mountainous area and they might not even be able to use that money to buy clothes, food, or whatever they need. And then there's clothes. I mean, if I wanted to give them clothes, my clothes probably wouldn’t be suitable for them. It could be really tough for not just me but my friends or other people to give clothes to the kids, 'cause they might not fit properly or just not be appropriate, you know?

So, my point is, I really believe that the kids in North Vietnam should have more chances to go to school. By giving them notebooks and pencils, they have the tools they need to learn and get the right opportunities in the future. Plus, it's a fact that in these mountainous areas, some parents keep their kids at home and don’t let them go to school.

I wouldn't choose a robot, because I believe it's one of the more expensive options, and there are yet much purpose to getting the robot for six years old. Granted, he could be really smart, and he is old enough to know how to play with a robot, know how to use his function, but I believe it doesn't have much of an education purpose for it. Turning six is when he will start going to school starting with primary school, and I would prefer him to do something more educational, like reading a book, even though it's a comic book, but it's in English. I didn't choose a school bag also, because I believe that each parent would pick those things and would buy those things preparing for their kids, and my nephew probably has a preference in the school bag that he wants, and maybe I wouldn't be able to choose his exact option, and if he doesn't like the school bag, he probably would have not used it and wasted a really good, perfect school bag. That's why I picked an English comic book, so I can introduce him my reading preference, and maybe even helping him reading it and talking to him about it. If I get to pick an English comic book for him, probably I would pick something out of the Marvel Universe, because it's one of the most common and one of the most well-known famous English comic books in the world in general, but also in Vietnam specifically. I would pick him an incredible hawk comic book, because that's one of my favourite characters, and I want him to know about that character also. He's also a smart scientist who has a little problem with controlling his emotions, and this comic book would teach him visually about colours, about the world, and all of those beautiful graphics, but also in the sense of knowledge and learning, he gets to learn about the language itself, English, through story and through captivating pictures, illustration, so I believe it's the best of both worlds kinda. You get to learn knowledge, but you also get to enjoy beautiful pictures.","Okay, so I wanna talk about my nephew turning six, and I think that’s like a really important birthday for a kid.

If you can take some short video and post it on the internet, you can get a lot of followers that can help you make a lot of money. But when you travel abroad, you can face various drawbacks, like the first travel abroad requires you to spend a lot of time and money. Or sometimes you can face some drawbacks, like acting when studying abroad. For example, my friend James had an accident last year when she traveled alone in Brazil. Now he is on a hard pistol and I think he needs a lot of time to become. Personally, I think travel abroad is so interesting, but now I do not have a lot of money to travel abroad, and I think I will travel abroad when I have enough money. And now my young brother studied abroad in Korea. In the next year, when I have enough money, I will visit Korea to visit my young brother. And to study abroad is more beneficial, and I think if you have a lot of money, you can travel around the world. Some people choose travel abroad.","Okay, so, you know, travel plays a really important role in our lives nowadays. Some people go abroad while others stick to traveling in their own countries. Today, I'm gonna talk about that. 

First off, traveling abroad is super beneficial. Like, when you visit other countries, you can learn a lot. You pick up some new knowledge and maybe even a bit of the local language and culture, which is really cool. Plus, traveling gives you more chances to build new relationships. I mean, if you study or travel abroad, it might even help you make some extra money. You could, like, take short videos and post them online, and if they get popular, you could gain a ton of followers, which could lead to cash flow.

But, you know, there are some downsides too. For example, traveling abroad often requires a lot of time and money. And sometimes there can be some risks, like accidents. My friend James had a pretty bad accident last year when he was traveling alone in Brazil. Now he's kinda struggling, and I think it's gonna take him a while to fully recover.

Personally, I find traveling abroad really interesting. But right now, I don't have enough money to travel. I'm hoping to travel abroad when I can save up enough. My younger brother is actually studying abroad in Korea right now. So next year, when I have the money, I plan to visit him there.

So yeah, studying abroad has its benefits, and if you’ve got the money, you can pretty much travel anywhere in the world. Some people definitely prefer to travel abroad, too.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_2/audio/HUST111223FIAI177/HUST1112230184-3.mp3,CD14_2,3

I feel it's more convenient to use in this way. The bank service I use may be like deposit money or saving online. I think it's very convenient and easy for me to do. I'm very happy with the service. It's supported by many bank tellers and the app runs very well. There's nothing to complain about it. Now let's talk about online shopping. As I'm still a student, my budget is not large. I just spend some time shopping online. Of course, there's nothing to complain about shopping online. It's very helpful. You can buy a stop and then some people will deliver it to your home with just reasonable fees. There are many kinds of products that are sold online. I think the most sold one is the family products. Because women are trained to go shopping more than men, the companies will be focusing on this. Shopping online is very popular in my country in recent years. It has changed the way people go shopping. Most people will not go to the shops. Instead, they stay at home, choose to pay with one and then it will be delivered to your house after one or two days. It's very convenient and it also doesn't cost much.","Okay, so let's talk about banking in my city. I gotta say, I’ve never actually been into a bank in my area, but I do a lot of banking online. I really feel like it’s way more convenient to use it this way. I mean, I use bank services like, you know, depositing money or saving online. It's super simple and easy for me, and I’m pretty happy with the service I get. It's all supported by quite a few bank tellers, and honestly, the app runs really smoothly. So yeah, there's nothing I can really complain about.

Now, moving on to online shopping—since I'm still a student, my budget isn't really that big, so I can only spend a little time shopping online. But, you know, there's nothing to complain about when it comes to shopping online either. It's really helpful. You just buy something, and then people deliver it right to your home for reasonable fees. 

There are a lot of products sold online, but I think the ones that sell the most are family products. Like, I guess because women tend to shop more than men, companies focus on that. Shopping online has really blown up in my country in recent years. It’s changed how people shop, for sure. Most people don’t even go to the stores anymore. They just stay at home, pick what they want, pay for it, and then it gets delivered to their house in like one or two days.

About the other things, making a class photo album or producing a class videos. Actually, I think the other option is really expensive and actually I know the price of making an album or class videos is really high and it's quite, it's make, it's worth a lot of money for creating this and actually sometimes people feel shy and don't really like the show that phrase on the cameras and maybe it's the lead to fake emotion and reaction when they are do something for keep memories and I have really I highly appreciate it's the real the real emotions of this. When talking about my choice is a desire designing a class uniform, I think these things is a really fabric and you can create a special things for keeping and preserving memories and actually you can write everything or draw anything you want in your closing especially you can create something special and memorable with your teams and with your classmates before graduation and some people who can write your signatures on the closing and actually is a really I mean it's a really memorable and meaningful and easy to handle to buy it. Well, when they designing class uniform they can listen to the voice of another classmates and actually I think it's the reunions, it creates a reunions and maybe you can more ideas about designing class uniform and you keep day by day. Well, as I said earlier making class photo I'm gonna producing a class videos with a lot of money and sometimes it's perhaps create a fake emotion in this product.","Okay, so if I were in a situation where I needed to keep memories of my student life before graduation, I'd definitely go with making a class uniform. You know, the other options like a class photo album or making class videos, I mean, those can get really pricey. I actually know how much it costs to create an album or a video, and it's kinda high, and that's a lot of money to spend on something like that. Plus, sometimes people feel shy about being in front of the camera, and that can lead to, like, fake emotions and reactions when they’re trying to capture memories. I really appreciate, you know, when feelings are real.

Now, talking about my choice of designing a class uniform, I think it’s a great way to create something tangible for memories. You can put anything you want on the fabric, like messages or drawings that represent your time together. It’s a special way to preserve those memories with your friends and classmates before graduation. And you can even have your classmates sign the uniforms, which makes it really memorable and meaningful.

When they’re designing the class uniform, they can all get together and share ideas, which really brings everyone closer. So, it's kind of like a reunion in itself, and you get to brainstorm together and come up with something unique. 

Like I said earlier, making a class photo album or producing class videos can cost a lot of money, and sometimes those can feel a bit staged, you know? So, I really think the class uniform is the best way to go!",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD17_3/audio/HUST2811234Q4J177/HUST2811230286-2.mp3,CD17_3,2

So there is a statement that higher education should be free to everyone. I completely agree with this statement for the following reasons. The first reason is a free higher education would create an equal chance for everyone. We all know that people, students from poor families, couldn't afford to do their further education and they had to start work very early to support for themselves. So if they were given the opportunities to receive the higher education, it is more likely that they could get the chance to enjoy the free education from the government. Another reason is a free higher education should be a solution to employment. We all know that the job market is very competitive these days and it is more and more difficult for everyone to find a good and stable job. So if you have a better qualifications, you surely have a better job and as a result, you could get higher salary and you could support your family better. Another reason why higher education should be free to everyone is that it will create a better advancement in technology. As you know, nowadays even we have a lot of workers who work in the technology sector and these employees will surely make a lot of great inventions to the society and they will have to boost up the economy and raise the living standards of everyone, of all the people in the society. I think it is reasonable to apply free higher education in Vietnam because it is an equal chance for everyone and if the government has a very clear procedure on how to apply it, the young people can easily get the opportunities successfully. I don't agree that university is the only way to success because we have a lot of workers who work in factories and they somehow contribute their part to the development of the society and they still have a very good job with a stable income to support their family. The lower level of education should be free to everyone. I think it is true for sure because the children need to learn how to...","Okay, so you know, like, these days, almost everyone thinks they have to go to college, right? But tuition fees are super high, which means a lot of people can't get that higher education. So there's this idea that higher education should, like, totally be free for everyone, and honestly, I completely agree with that for a few reasons. 

First off, free higher education would really level the playing field for everyone. I mean, we all know that students from poorer families often can’t afford to pursue further education and end up having to work super early just to support themselves. So, if they had the chance to get higher education for free, it would really help them out a lot.

Another point is that free higher education could, like, seriously help with employment issues. I mean, we know how competitive the job market is these days, right? It’s getting tougher and tougher to find a good stable job. But if you have better qualifications, you’re definitely in a better position to land a good job with a higher salary, and that means you can support your family better.

Also, making higher education free would boost advancements in technology. You know, there are so many people working in the tech sector today, and they’re making some amazing inventions that benefit society. This could really help boost the economy and lift living standards for everyone.

I think it's totally reasonable to implement free higher education in Vietnam, especially since it would give everyone an equal chance to succeed. If the government sets up a clear process for it, young people would have a much easier time accessing those opportunities.

And, by the way, I don’t believe that university is the only path to success. There are a ton of factory workers who contribute to society and they’re doing well too, with stable jobs and income to support their families.

However I believe that the benefits of traveling by plane is, I can mention, is the fastest way to travel from one plane to another plane. And actually I believe that my English is so important for me because nowadays people all around the world using the English and English is considered as the international language. So when I have enough ability to communicate in English I can like communicate with other people from all around the world and maybe in the future when I get the job I believe that English can be something that boost or that helped me to get promotion in my career. So the things that make me feel difficult when I learning English is, actually in Vietnam we are learning English by studying vocabulary and like studying the grammar and it's like practicing so and that's make my speaking skill is the worst in the among the four skill and that also the difficulties when every student in Vietnam face to face up to like they like the practicing this result in best result. So actually each skill will have their own improve their own method to improve my English skill so like in in in listening skill I have to like hear the conversation and watch a YouTube video about the English conversation and in my speaking skill I mean I have to practice every day in front of the mirror and also face to face with the others. About the reading and writing I mean I really have to read more novels books in English even the academic research to improve the vocabulary and also the grammar and this and reading","Okay, so I've actually never traveled by plane, so I don't have any experience with airplane services in my country.

So, when I get better at communicating in English, I can talk to people from all around the world, and maybe, in the future, when I get a job, I think English could really help me get promoted in my career.

Now, the thing that makes it hard for me when I'm learning English is that, in Vietnam, we usually focus on studying vocabulary and grammar, which kind of stuff makes my speaking skills, like, the worst out of the four skills. And I think that's a common struggle for many students in Vietnam. We really need more practice to see better results. 

So, each skill has its own method to improve. For listening, I try to listen to conversations and watch YouTube videos in English. And for speaking, I mean, I practice every day in front of the mirror and with others if I can. When it comes to reading and writing, I know I really have to dive into novels and English books, even academic stuff to boost my vocabulary and get better at grammar and all that.

First of all, the cheese is a source of food. It will provide their fruit from this. Agriculture has been developed for a thousand years and cheese is the source of this food. For example, Vietnamese is very famous for this rice. It is in the western country, which is very famous and plays an important role in life. Next, the trees like cheese, plants will prevent a flood. As we know that the environment is changing. It changes day by day and it has the flood causes from the deforestation. If there is not a tree in this place, the flood and the water will go straight down from the mountainous area to the plain. It is a strong point that the tree is giving a better environment. Because it will generate all seasons, which contribute to the atmosphere more cleaner and it can refresh the contamination in the air. The last idea I would like to tell is that trees will contribute to the study of the scientists. Thus, trees have development from scratch of the earth. It could be an effect if the study of the scientists can pay attention to the development of the earth long history. They can find out the development of the people and the trees and also the natural in the future. Regarding to the following question, first, I totally absolutely love planting trees. Planting trees give me the feeling that I can give the experience and the birth for a plant. It is quite an evening bring to our life a very interesting thing. Next, the second one. I think this problem should be regulated by the government because the authority only has the right to increase and to describe and to design the space in the city. So if there is enough space, we can call for the action from the environment and the lava. So they can give more increased space in the city. And the last question. The government and the authorities should permit the farmer to protect the forest by themselves. This is an existing fight in Vietnam today, and it's very essential to protect the forest. And the raising awareness is also important, too.","Okay, so I wanna talk about the role of trees in our lives, because they’re super important. First off, trees are a source of food, right? They provide us with fruits and stuff. Agriculture has been around for like thousands of years, and trees are a big part of that. For example, in Vietnam, rice is really famous and you know, that's partly thanks to the trees and the agriculture there. 

Next, trees like, they actually help prevent floods. Because we all know the environment’s changing, and it’s changing super fast. Deforestation can lead to floods, and without trees, water just rushes down from the mountains to the plains, which is not great. So yeah, trees really help keep the environment better. They clean the air and, you know, help make it more refreshing.

And the last thing I wanna say is that trees also help scientists study how the Earth has changed over time. They can look at trees to learn about the history of our planet and how people and nature have developed together. 

Now, to answer the next question, I absolutely love planting trees. It gives me this feeling like I’m helping bring a new life into the world, which is pretty cool. 

As for the second question, I think the government should be the one to regulate against environmental problems. I mean, they have the power to design and manage spaces in cities, so if there’s enough room for green areas, then we can definitely take action for the environment.

And about the last question, I really think the government should let farmers protect the forests themselves. This is a big issue in Vietnam right now, and it’s super important to keep the forests safe. Plus, raising awareness about this is really important too!",8.5,9.0,9.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC167/HUST3110230135-3.mp3,CD16_2,3

I can understand that people keep them to make a chance for kids, for our kids to have a chance to see them. We not go outside, don't have to go outside. They only have to pay some kind of money and then go to the zoo and see them or feed them. But I am not support of this because I think the disadvantage of keeping an animal in the zoo is just like make them lots of freedom, like a speck and like a survival skill. Sometimes I can see how hard when they, I can see in the eyes of them when I was a kid, I can feel what they are feeling about. It's just like, I can feel that it's just like me if I have been knocked in a cave, I cannot happy with that life. I think day by day it's cool like make the animal exhausted about their feeling and that is not good. Sometimes it will be dangerous for tourists if they can't feed them, especially a tiger or some panda. So we might see a lot of wild animals they keep in the zoo just like hippo, rhino, tiger, monkey. Sometimes they still keep chicken and bird, rabbit. So maybe it still have some benefit to give an animal in the zoo like to create, to keep their gene or make more generation of them. I don't think that is the way to protect wildlife because I went to Fukuoka, they have the model like savories. Savories is not like zoos because they create the environment just like where they have been. So the animals they have a huge space to live, they have a chance to like hunting and eating like the normal. So I think that is the good model we should develop and we need to involve in some kind of zoo like in the zoo in Hanoi. And I don't think that is good. You might see a lot of animals they look like not big at all, they look like exhausted, they look always hungry and dirty. So this is a serious thing that we need to take serious action about it to protect and have a serious eye on these issues to protect and keep our plants more beautiful. And for next generation they can't see the real wild animals.","Okay, so, you know, as someone who really respects nature and loves islands and wild animals, I’m not really in support of keeping animals in zoos. I get that people might think zoos give kids a chance to see these animals up close without going out into the wild, and yeah, they can just pay a fee and go see them or even feed them. But I just feel like that’s not right.

I think the major downside of keeping animals in zoos is that it takes away their freedom and survival skills. Like, sometimes I look into the eyes of these animals and I can feel what they're feeling, you know? It reminds me of if I was stuck in a cave—I wouldn’t be happy at all. I think it can really wear them down emotionally, and that's not good. Plus, it can be dangerous for people too, especially if they try to feed animals like tigers or pandas.

When you think about it, you see all sorts of wild animals in zoos—hippos, rhinos, tigers, monkeys. They even have chickens, birds, and rabbits. I mean, there might be some benefits to housing animals in zoos, like helping preserve their genes or boosting their populations. But I don’t think that’s the best way to protect wildlife.

Like, I remember visiting Fukuoka, where they have a model that’s like a safari. It's not the same as a zoo because they create environments that mimic where the animals actually come from. The animals there have so much more space to roam, and they can hunt and eat like they would in the wild. I think that’s a much better model we should aim for.

Honestly, when I visit certain zoos, like the one in Hanoi, a lot of the animals just don’t seem healthy. They look small, exhausted, always hungry, and they often look dirty. It’s really concerning, and I think we need to take serious action to address these issues.

audio/HUST24223GHH9167/HUST2402230070-3.ogg," I think raising pets is very beneficial to the elderly because they can help them release stress in their daily life. For example, a dog can help a person release their stress just by petting it or having a conversation with the dog. It also increases social interaction. For some elderly people who cannot leave their house, it is very beneficial to have a pet around them. It is better to have a conversation with the dog even though the pet doesn't necessarily understand what the person is saying. It still helps them to have some sort of social interaction. It also gives them an exercise partner. For example, a walk out in the park. It is better to have someone or something with you to make it a better experience for the elderly. For blind people, they can also have a dog or a different kind of pet to help them find their way around the streets and to warn other people that they are blind so they can get out of their way. In my country, dogs and cats are usually the most popular types of pets. There are also different kinds of pets as well. For example, some people like to raise pigs for pets. Some people like birds, parrots. Some even like to have a pet lizard. In my opinion, I think pets are not exactly too well taken care of in my country. There are some people who take care of their pets really well. They are also very comfortable. They give them clothes, bring them to salons, have their hair cut, give them showers. But mostly people in the countryside don't take care of their pets that well. Usually they just leave them out in the open to survive on their own and just give them food every day. I think people will most likely not to spend more money on their pets in the future. Some people will, but most people I don't think they will. It's hard enough to make ends meet for themselves. So the idea of spending more money on a pet is not very good.","Okay, so I think raising pets is really beneficial for elderly people, you know? Like, they can help them relieve stress in their daily lives. For example, having a dog around can really help. Just petting the dog or even talking to it can make a big difference. It also boosts social interaction, which is super important. 

Like, for some elderly folks who can’t really leave their houses, having a pet can be a game changer. I mean, even if the dog doesn’t understand what they're saying, just having that conversation helps them connect with something, right? Plus, pets can be great exercise partners, too. For instance, going for a walk in the park is much nicer when you have someone or something to share that with. 

And for blind people, having a guide dog or another type of pet can really help them navigate the streets. The dog can alert others that they need to move aside, which is really helpful. 

In my country, dogs and cats are usually the most popular pets. But you know, some people have different kinds of pets too, like pigs or birds, even parrots, and some folks go for lizards. 

But honestly, I think pets aren't always taken care of the best in my country. Sure, there are people who treat their pets really well—like they buy them clothes, take them to salons to get their hair done, give them baths—all that good stuff. But in the countryside, it’s a different story. Many just let their pets roam outside to fend for themselves and only give them food every day. 

Looking ahead, I don’t think most people will spend more money on their pets. I mean, some might, but for a lot of people, it’s tough enough just making ends meet for themselves.

Because I think that people in the mountainous, especially children, they are very poor and they don't have a good condition. They don't have a good condition to buy food, clothes and everything they need. So I think if they have a lot of money, or if they can buy things like clothes, like rice and meat to provide enough nutrition for their body to grow. The second one I think is some notebooks and pencils, because in mountainous children I think they don't have enough chance to study in urban areas. If you can give them notebooks and pencils, they can learn how to write, learn how to do math and they can keep their learning continuously. The last one I think is, I think, some old clothes, because we all know that all children don't have the same size. So if we cannot choose the correct size for them, it will be too big or too short, too long or too small. So it's very not good for children to have some clothes, because the most important thing I mentioned from the beginning is money. So they can have money and they can buy suitable clothes for them to feel warm when they live in a mountain which is very cold. And they can buy food like rice, meat and also some things to heat the heater and make the house warm so they can live comfortably.","Okay, so if I were to participate in a charity event to help kids in mountainous areas, I really think my best option would be to give them some money. And why is that? Well, 'cause the people there, especially the children, they’re really poor and they don’t have the best conditions, you know? They struggle to buy food, clothes, and all the essential stuff they need. So, I mean, if they have some cash, they can buy things like clothes, rice, and meat, which would help them get enough nutrition for their bodies to grow.

And then, I’d also think about giving them some notebooks and pencils. ‘Cause, honestly, these kids don’t really get as many chances to study compared to kids in urban areas. So if we can provide them with notebooks and pencils, they can learn how to write and do math, and keep their education going.

Lastly, I’d mention maybe some old clothes, but, you know, it’s tricky with sizes. Kids all grow at different rates, right? So if we can’t pick the right size, the clothes might be too big or too small, and that wouldn’t be great for them. That said, like I mentioned before, I still think money is the most important thing, 'cause with that, they can choose the right size and buy warm clothes for those cold mountain days. Plus, they could get food like rice and meat, and maybe even things to heat their houses, so they can live a bit more comfortably.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_2/audio/HUST6723KTLX166/HUST0607230132-2.mp3,CD11_2,2

Now, Facebook can bring us closer together in many ways, but it can also have some negative influences on its users. Why? Well this is because, why using Facebook? Well it's true that we can chat or video calls to anybody whether they are half a mile away or they are half a globe away. Now this is, when it comes to bad influences, I can say the most obvious influence that it can have on its users is that it is bad for their eyes. Well, this is due to the fact that whenever they use it throughout the day or if they use it too much, it will have negative impacts on their eyesight because, well, looking at the monitors or their phones all day long would not be beneficial for anybody and hence this is bad for anybody's eyes to be using Facebook all the time. Another bad influence is that whenever people use Facebook, they are just chatting to each other through a chatting system, which means that they are not socially interacting. So this means that whenever people chat to each other on Facebook, it will reduce their social interactions and if they just always sit indoors all day and chat to each other using Facebook, they will not have the social interactions that everybody needs and this also means that their social skills would not develop if not go down. So it's one of the downsides that people should consider before using Facebook. Now over the last ten years, over the last decades, I think that the numbers of Facebook users in Vietnam has tripled. This is because as more people have access to the Internet, they get to use Facebook easier and this is why the number of people who use Facebook is increasing dramatically over the last decades. I remember just a few years ago, some of my friends don't even know what Facebook is, but now they are using it and I myself do not know what Facebook is a decade ago until a friend of mine told me that it is really good and it is really cheap and all you need to have is an Internet connection and you should really download it. Not until then do I know about the existence of Facebook. So I believe that the stories that I've told have really showed how Facebook users have increased over the last decades. It's basically just people telling each other how convenient it is and how good it is and people just stay connected using Facebook. And in the near future, I think that the number of users who use this social media or this social platform would increase dramatically. The reason I have this is because, well, come rain or shine, people would still tell each other about the convenience of this social media and I personally myself would just use it whenever I find myself with a loose end because it is a good source of entertainment. Moreover, it helps me stay connected with my other friends and my abroad friends. So I think that due to its conveniences, it will be.","Okay, so when we're talking about social media, one of the platforms that everybody knows would be Facebook, or now I think they call it the Metaverse or something like that, but for sure, it’s still Facebook. Now, Facebook can really bring us closer together in a lot of ways, but it also has some negative influences on users, you know? 

So, why is that? Well, for one, with Facebook, we can chat or do video calls with anyone, whether they’re like just half a mile away or literally on the other side of the globe. But on the flip side, one of the most obvious negative impacts is that it’s not good for our eyes. Like, if you're staring at screens all day or just scrolling through your phone too much, it can really mess with your eyesight. I mean, looking at a monitor or phone nonstop isn’t beneficial for anyone, right?

Another bad influence is that when people are using Facebook, they tend to just chat through messages. So they're not actually interacting face-to-face, which means they miss out on those real social interactions. If folks are just sitting indoors, chatting on Facebook, they’re not developing their social skills. It’s kind of one of those downsides that people should definitely think about before diving into Facebook usage.

Now, over the last ten years, I’d say the number of Facebook users in Vietnam has, like, tripled. This is mainly because more and more people have access to the Internet, which makes it easier to use Facebook. I remember just a few years back, some of my friends didn’t even know what Facebook was! But now, everybody’s using it. Honestly, I didn’t even know about Facebook until a friend of mine told me about it—saying it was super useful and cheap, and all you needed was an Internet connection. That’s when I got hooked.

So I really think my experience shows how Facebook usage has exploded over the past decade. It’s just people telling each other how convenient and great it is, and that’s what keeps everyone connected through Facebook. Looking ahead, I believe the number of users for this social media platform is gonna keep growing dramatically. I mean, come rain or shine, people are gonna keep sharing how handy it is, you know? Personally, I find myself using it whenever I’ve got a bit of free time since it’s a great source of entertainment, and it helps me stay in touch with friends, even those living abroad. So yeah, I think because of all these conveniences, it’s gonna stick around for sure.",10.0,10.0,9.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_2/audio/HUST24223PUF8167/HUST2402230184-3.mp3,CD7_2,3

I’ve heard that writing blogs helps you connect with other people and can really deepen your understanding of the topics you write about. So yeah, I think writing a blog is pretty important. If I do start one, I might write about my profession, which is endoscopy. You know, in Vietnam, there aren’t many blogs focusing on medical professions, so I think it could be really beneficial to share my thoughts and, like, provide more knowledge and spark discussions with other doctors in the country.

Now, about anger—it's kind of a different topic. I usually feel angry when things aren’t going well with my projects or my work. During those times, I try to clear my head by exercising to cool down, and I also talk to my wife. She's really great at helping me calm down when I’m feeling angry. Another thing I do is remind myself that I need to embrace my anger. It’s, like, unavoidable, right? You know it’ll happen, so I just try to let it slide. Once the anger passes, I can get back to focusing on my work and projects. Because honestly, when you’re angry, it’s hard to concentrate, and it’s probably not a good idea to, you know, talk to people during that time. It’s like you need a little break. 

And funny enough, another way I tend to deal with my anger is by buying a lot of stuff! It’s like my way of distracting myself from the anger—I don't think about it too much when I’m shopping.",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230017-1.mp3,CD9_1,1
audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220011-3.ogg," Well, I'm actually very enthusiastic to talk about this topic because I'm a teacher myself. And I can tell you a lot about the experience I had as a teacher and a lot about things I learned as a teacher. First of all, I believe that teaching efficiently is a lot about entertainment. Just imagine, attention span for people right now because of the phones, the internet is very short. People cannot really keep focus. And just imagine if you're like, you know, six or eight years kid who has to keep focus on English, the language he doesn't understand or she doesn't. So you have to be very entertaining in the way you deliver the materials. A lot of games, a lot of movement. I also believe that body language and a lot of it and the way you use your intonations, use your voice is also very important for teaching. Teaching anything well. Of course, it has to be based on knowledge. But what in my opinion is even more important than knowledge is proper preparation. Each lesson that you're trying to give has to be planned and it has to be planned within a certain timeframe. Like you should know how much time each part of your lesson will take and also you have to be able to improvise and change on the go because sometimes in the class things just don't go your way. So to keep up. First of all, you have to be entertaining. Second, you have to plan. Third, you need to have the good understanding of your subject. Fourth, I'd say the fourth trick of teaching is actually trying to give a bit of attention to each student you have. I mean in a class where you have 46 students and you have 40 minutes, it's not always possible but sometimes you should. Also tell students about yourself. You get a little bit more personal with them. They want to see a human behind the teacher. That will actually help a lot to teach efficiently. I believe that patience is also a very, very important quality for a teacher because sometimes you just have to repeat things like seven times, eight times, sometimes even ten times. It's just repetition. You have to be patient. You have to remember that you've been there. At some point you tried to learn English and you failed just like the students you're teaching right now sometimes. So you need to be patient, yes. Also you have to be very approachable as a teacher. Students shouldn't be afraid to ask you questions and ask for help. I don't think computers can replace teachers simply because I've been doing this job and it just requires so much personal energy and personal connections to just get some points across and computers just cannot keep the kids interested. A good teacher can change a student's life. Do you agree? I nearly agree, disagree. I believe a lot of different things can change a person's life. Yes, of course, a teacher can change a student's life if he is an enigmatic enough person, but it also can be a good book. It can be a good movie. A lot of things. So, yeah, I guess I agree. It can.","Okay, so I'm really excited to talk about this topic because, you know, I'm a teacher myself. I’ve got a lot of experiences to share and I've learned quite a bit along the way. First off, I really think that teaching well has a lot to do with entertainment. Just think about it—people's attention spans are really short these days because of phones and the internet. It's tough for anyone to focus, right? And if you have like, a six or eight-year-old kid trying to focus on English, which is a language they don't even get yet, it’s really challenging. So you gotta be entertaining when you deliver the material. That means lots of games and movement, you know?

And, you know, I also believe that body language and how you use your voice is super important in teaching as well. It’s not just about having knowledge; it’s about being prepared. Each lesson needs to be planned out and you should know how much time you want to spend on each part. But sometimes, things don’t go as planned in class, so you gotta be ready to improvise and change up your approach on the fly.

So, first, be entertaining. Second, plan your lessons. Third, really understand your subject. And I’d say the fourth thing about teaching is to give a bit of attention to each of your students. I mean, if you’ve got a class of like 46 kids and only 40 minutes, it’s not always easy, but you should try to connect with them a bit. Share some stuff about yourself too. They wanna see the human side of their teacher, it makes a big difference.

Patience is also really important for a teacher. Sometimes you gotta repeat things like seven, eight, or even ten times. It’s all about repetition, and you’ve gotta be patient and remember that you’ve been where they are before—trying to learn English and possibly struggling just like they do.

And, you know, it’s important to be approachable too. Students shouldn’t be scared to ask you questions or for help. I honestly don’t think computers can replace teachers because this job requires so much personal energy and connection to really get points across. Computers just can't keep kids interested the way a good teacher can.

Now, do I think a good teacher can change a student's life? I mean, I sorta agree with that. I think a lot of things can change someone’s life—not just a teacher. It could be a great book or a powerful movie, you know? So, yeah, I guess I agree that a teacher can definitely have an impact, but there are a lot of things that can do the same.",9.5,9.5,10.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220011-3.mp3,CD3,3

Yes, I'm very satisfied with my mobile phone service because nowadays the society is very developed so the mobile phone service is to the quality of the mobile phone service will raise a lot and as I was served well with my mobile phone in my opinion what makes a good mobile phone service is that they care a lot and the cost is cheap and have a lot of the policies to encourage us to use that service. Let's talk about renting a house or a flat. Yes, I've ever rent a house because I am a student right now so I have to rent a house to study in Hanoi and I prefer to pay the rent monthly because I can afford it well other than pay the rent quarterly or yearly because I have to pay a lot of money for that. What I like in a rented house is that the cost of a rented house in Hanoi is not expensive or too much and the host makes us feel very comfortable to live in their house and they can help us whenever we can.","Okay, so, you know, I always use my mobile phone when I'm out and even when I’m studying, ‘cause it’s really modern and super convenient.

Personally, I think a good mobile phone service is one that really cares about its customers, plus, it should be affordable and have plenty of policies to encourage us to stick with it. 

Now, about renting a house or a flat, yeah, I’ve rented a place before, especially since I’m a student right now and I need to rent a house to study in Hanoi. I prefer paying rent monthly 'cause that's way easier for me to handle than, like, paying quarterly or yearly since that’s just too much money all at once.

In my opinion, far away from home college life have some disadvantage. First of all, potential generous is across when you don't live with your family. You can come far from home to study in a spring city. You have to live alone. There are so many generous things in a spring city or spring village when you come. You don't know about the city, the culture here. You will feel strain. It's not safe when you live alone without your parents or your brother. The second disadvantage of college far from home is homesickness. When you live with your family, you can stand by your mother, father, sister, brother every day, everywhere. Of course, when you come to the other city to study, you have to live only by them. They can miss them whenever you want. Maybe after the pressure of studying, you can talk with your mother or your parents. It will make you more homesick. It's a high living cost. You know when you leave another brand, you have to pay the money for the house or for the castle. If you don't study in a college far from home, you will have free fees. It's not free for you when you come to the other city. You can rent the house or the hostel near your college.","Okay, so I wanna talk about college life when you’re living far from home. In my view, there are some clear disadvantages to it. First off, you know, there's the issue of loneliness when you don’t live with your family. Like, if you go to a new city to study, you gotta learn to take care of yourself. And, I mean, there’s so much that’s new in a city you’ve never been to before, like the culture and everything, and that can feel really overwhelming. It’s kinda risky too, you know, being by yourself without your parents or siblings around.

Then there’s homesickness, which is a big deal. When you’re living with your family, you see your mom, dad, sister, or brother every day. But when you move to another city, that’s gone. You might miss them a lot, especially after a long day of studying when all you really wanna do is talk to them. It can really make you feel down, just missing home.

Also, yeah, there’s the cost of living. Like, when you’re in a different city, you have to pay for your rent or a place to stay, whether that’s a house or a hostel. If you were at home, you wouldn’t have to worry about those expenses. So, you gotta budget for all that stuff when you decide to study far from home.

In the first, we will organize a party in the resource. Second is in Red Town. And last is one student house. I think the last subject is suitable for us. To organize a party in one student can be really cheap. Because you know that we have a student, of course we don't have a lot of money. And I think getting some party at home is quite cheap and convenient. In there, we can play some minigames together, cooking together, or sing karaoke at home. I don't choice the first subject because in Red Town, we cannot find a Red Town near my city. And we must drive about 100km from the near-death, mostly Red Town resource. And I don't choice the two subjects in Red Town because in there, the food and service is really expensive. It's not suitable for us because we don't have a lot of money. And I think in there, we don't have the convenience to talk about or share some information. In Red Town, I think taking a party in one student house is a bad choice for us. Because it helps us accept both time and money and we can play some informal sports or play in-game together.","Okay, so I think it's pretty interesting that my friends are planning to throw a party at the end of the semester. We've got three options for where to do it. First, we're thinking about organizing it at this place called Resource. Then, there's another option in Red Town. And the last one is at a student's house. Honestly, I think the last option is the best for us.

Having a party at a student’s house can be really cheap, you know? Since we're all students and don’t have a ton of money, I think that's a big plus. Plus, it's super convenient. We could play some mini-games together, cook, or even sing karaoke at home. 

I'm not really into the first option 'cause in Red Town, we can't find a place close to my city, and we'd have to drive like 100 kilometers, which is kinda far. So, that's a no-go for me. And about the second option in Red Town, the food and service there are really expensive. It's just not gonna work for us since we’re on a budget, you know? Also, it wouldn't be as easy to chat or share info there either.

Usually, I use my motorbike to go to work because I am currently working as a teacher. You know, the distance from my home to school is about 11 or 12 km, which is quite far. So I think that using motorbikes is the most convenient way. The second question. I think that the most popular means of transport in my country, not just my province but all over my country, is motorbikes. You know, the traffic jam or the traffic congestion in Vietnam, especially in Hanoi, is a big problem. So people usually use motorbikes to commute from work to work or to school because it is the most convenient one for its size and its convenience. I think that the meaning of transport I like best is the car. Actually, I just passed the driving test two weeks ago. I chose this kind of transport because I think that when having your private vehicle, it is convenient for you to travel to anywhere that you want. Even though the traffic jam in Hanoi is quite excessive, I still think that using car when you want to travel is the best way for its capacity of carrying about 4 to 5 persons. The second advantage of commuting by car is that if you have a lot of things to bring with you when you travel to somewhere, a car can do it. Actually, I'm a caring person so I always bring a lot of things with me whenever I go to work. The reason why I chose car is because it is my favourite transport.","Okay, so the first thing I wanna talk about is how I get to school or work every day.

Now, for the second question, I think the most popular means of transport in my country, not just in my province but all over, is definitely motorbikes.

So, people usually stick to using motorbikes to commute, whether it's to work or school, 'cause they're just so convenient for their size and everything.

Now, if I had to pick my favorite kind of transport, honestly, I’d say it's a car. I just passed my driving test like two weeks ago, so I'm really excited about that. I chose a car 'cause I think having your own vehicle is really convenient for traveling wherever you wanna go. Even if the traffic jams in Hanoi can get pretty crazy, I still believe using a car is the best option when you're traveling, especially since it can fit about four to five people at once.

And another thing is, if you’ve got a lot of stuff to bring with you when you’re going somewhere, a car can definitely handle that.

Another thing I want to choose this play because it quite near for my when you compare it to we're quite near to my university where I am learning and on the other side I also often want to go to the the play which have a water it should like a lake a river or a sea or ocean because as you know the the climate in I mean the the temperature in Hanoi is really high recently so I think when I go to the the play which have the water like a lake or river it's so give it more comfortable and I also feel excited in the trip instead go to the play which is hot and which,"Okay, so I wanna talk about field trips, like the ones I wanna go on this week.

They ended up having a conversation, right? And then, the turtle gave the king a sword as a gift for their meeting. 

But honestly, back then, I was just a kid, and I didn't really believe the story. I thought it was just a fairy tale and not something real. So, that's kinda why I want to go back there and learn more about this story. I think there’s more info that I can find out about it, and maybe after this trip, I can finally figure out if it's just a fairy tale or if there's some real history behind it. 

Another reason I chose this place is that it’s pretty close to my university, which is super convenient for me. Plus, I really like visiting places near water, like lakes, rivers, or even the sea.

Demissioning, dismissing them would be too harsh because it will eliminate the chances of for them being able to do their test again, and reducing 50% of the total scores. If their tests would be considered high enough, reducing 50% of the total score would cause those students to pass unpurposely, which is why I believe giving them a zero is the best option. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","Okay, so about the punishment for students who cheat on exams, I really think the best option is to give them a zero. Why do I say that? Well, I believe that when you give them a zero, it makes them have to redo all the tests from scratch, and they really need to learn that material to be able to do it again, which is super important. Now, I mean, dismissing them from the exam would be way too harsh because it cuts off their chance to retake the test, and just reducing their score by 50% isn’t a good idea either. If their scores are high enough, then that reduction could let them pass without actually putting in the work, right? So, I honestly believe that giving them a zero is the way to go.

The reason for this choice is because in my opinion, money is the most convenient thing for the wedding. My friend can receive this money and can use this to buy anything they want. It is also very convenient for me to give the money instead of January or couple go this. Because of some reason, first of all, January is also the good option. But maybe some people can have the allergy with the January material. And it also depends on the style. For example, if I like this style and I buy it for my friend but they don't like it, I don't want to make a gift that my friend doesn't like it. And the second is the couple go this. It's the same reason with the January that some couple don't like the couple go this. And it is very hard to choose the suitable go this for them, for both of them. So I may think the money is the best gift for me to give them because they can do anything with this gift. And it is also because when they open the wedding, they have to spend a lot of money. So I think if I give them money, they can handle a little bit with this. And it is also like I can't buy beside the money. Maybe I can also give them the other wedding gift. But for me, the money is the best choice. That's all of my talking. Yes.","Okay, so if I find myself in a situation where I'm going to a wedding and I have to pick a wedding gift, I’d probably choose to give money from the options I have. The reason for this is 'cause, in my opinion, cash is just the most practical choice for a wedding gift. My friend can take the money and use it to buy whatever they want, you know? 

It's also way easier for me to just give money instead of considering jewelry or couple’s gifts. Like, jewelry’s a nice option too, but some people might have allergies to certain materials or they might not even like the style I pick. Imagine if I think it looks great and then they totally hate it! I wouldn’t wanna give a gift they don’t like, right?

And then there's the couple’s gifts, which kind of have the same issue. It can be really tricky to find something that both of them will like. So, yeah, I just think money is the best gift because it gives them the freedom to spend it how they like. Plus, when they get married, they usually end up spending a lot, so having some extra cash can help them out with that too. 

I mean, I could also think about giving them something else along with the money, but for me, cash just feels like the best choice. So, anyway, that’s my take on it!",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_2/audio/HUST6923DQQK166/HUST0609230107-2.mp3,CD13_2,2

First of all, I think that the number of natural resources cannot supply enough for the mass amount of population. Secondly, during weight, it's also another problem. When the number of population increased, the number of waste that they released into the environment would also increase as a result. This is especially severe for developing or under developing countries, for example Vietnam, because currently they have a developed and modern situation, a modern system to deal with the number of waste that people produce every day. In order to solve this problem, I think governments should provide more policies to control the birth rate or having rules and policies to deal with the problems such as natural resources and weight. For natural resources, I think we can change into using renewable energy, such as wind energy or tidal power. For using weight, I think governments should encourage people to recycle and reduce more. Overall, it is obvious that overpopulation will bring some damages to the environment, including damaging natural resources and increasing the amount of waste. To deal with that, governments should raise people awareness about the problems of overpopulation and have policies.","Okay, so nowadays, yeah, the population is really growing, and I think that’s gonna create some serious threats to the environment. First off, you know, there just aren't enough natural resources to keep up with this huge number of people. And then there’s, like, the waste issue. When the population goes up, the amount of waste they throw into the environment goes up too. And this is especially tough for developing or underdeveloped countries, like Vietnam. Right now, they’re working on getting a modern system in place to handle all the waste people produce every day, but it’s a real challenge.

To tackle this problem, I think governments should introduce more policies to manage birth rates or, you know, put in place rules to address issues like natural resources and waste management. For natural resources, we could definitely shift towards using renewable energy, like wind energy or tidal power. And then for waste, I think governments should really push for recycling and promoting ways to reduce waste.

Overall, it’s pretty clear that overpopulation is gonna cause some harm to the environment, like by depleting natural resources and increasing waste.

It's not like like if you like to wear it you wear it, but it's a must in Vietnam and Do you like wearing a new form? I love wearing an uniform when I was like a child when I was six years old I have never worn anything that's similar to others and I feel like I'm so special I'm not like those five years old without any any like special clothes but as days go by I've been wearing too I've been wearing uniform too like Too occasionally too too much that I just grown Born born on it. Yes. So what are the benefits of wearing uniform at school? Yes, of course. It is more to wear uniform every day, but Sometimes you can't because of the uniform students or shouldn't should it will not shouldn't not shouldn't but will not Focus on what to wear every day and they will focus more on the subjects of school And the things I learned at school more than what to wear today How can I be prettier than her by wearing this beautiful dress or something? They are all the same so you don't have any clothes competitions here, right? It's not a runway and about home punishment Yes, it's an Asian things I Been punished a lot by my friend my parents my grandparents are nights But not their sons and daughters They are really good at using their stick using the belt. I don't know What what are the skill there? So where did they learn those skills? they use the belts like Brooke Bruce Lee and they use the stick like Jackie Chan. Yeah and a Common type of home punishment. I just tell you one of the more moral one Those one though the last ones are unethical like the bells and the stick like hitting you Well, one of the more one is that you have to do a lot of housework Yes as a young child as I'm not an only child I'm a second child and I'm a youngest in a family so I was very prone to being not doing homework not too prone to Relaxing why my sister doing housework? So my punish is doing housework. Yes","Okay, so let's talk about wearing uniforms to school. I’ve worn a uniform at school 'cause, you know, I’m a Vietnamese student, and it’s just how it is in Vietnam. Like, it’s not really optional or anything; you have to wear it. So, do you like wearing a uniform? I loved wearing it when I was a kid. I mean, when I was like six years old, I never really wore anything like what other kids wore. It made me feel kinda special, you know? Like, I wasn’t like those other five-year-olds who didn't have any unique clothes.

But over time, I got used to wearing uniforms so much that it just became a part of me. 

So, what are the benefits of wearing a uniform at school? Well, yeah, it can be a bit boring wearing the same thing every day, but the cool part is, you don’t spend time worrying about what to wear. Students can focus more on their studies instead of, like, figuring out how to look better than each other every day. It’s not a fashion show, right? Plus, it really cuts down on the whole clothes competition. 

Now, about home punishment—yeah, that's a pretty Asian thing. I’ve been punished a lot by my friends, and, uh, my parents and grandparents too. And it’s funny 'cause they’re not really hard on their sons and daughters; they’ve kinda got this skill thing down. They’re like pros with belts and sticks! I have no idea where they learned that from, but they’re like Bruce Lee with belts and Jackie Chan with sticks. 

But for real, one of the more standard punishments—without getting too wild, you know—is doing housework. As a kid, I wasn’t the only child; I’m the second child and the youngest in my family, so I kinda got away with not doing my homework while my sister did all the housework.

The reason why I say that is when you reading history book. This is official material and provide you a lot of industry regarding the topic. However, because you are from another country, if you reading history book, you can understand clearly the content of this book without the misunderstanding of some work. When you reading history book, if you get some difficult work, you need to stop and find it from the dictionaries and easy to understand totally of this content. About the other option like going to the museum and watching documentary, I think it's so funny and is it a rating when you going to the museum or watching the documentary. However, I can feel death because you are come from another country, so you find easy to understand totally the contents of this. Actually, you will get stuck in the reading description in the museum or watching documentary because I think most material Vietnamese history is written by the students. So, I think it's very interesting. This is the reason why I highly recommend you to reading history book for understanding totally every content regarding the Vietnamese history. Oh, yes, and I have an idea like documentary or reading is not convey sufficient contents and I think it's very interesting. I think it's very interesting.","Okay, so another option I wanna recommend for my foreign students is option three, which is learning Vietnamese history through history books. The reason I suggest this is 'cause when you’re reading a history book, you get official material that provides a lot of insights about the topic. But, you know, since you're from another country, reading a history book can really help you understand the content more clearly, without getting confused by some of the words. 

Like, if you come across some difficult words while reading, it’s a good idea to stop and look them up in a dictionary. That way, you really get the full picture of what you’re reading. 

Now, other options like going to a museum or watching documentaries are fun, right? I mean, they can be really engaging. But I can totally see how that might be tough 'cause, you know, you might find it hard to understand everything, especially since a lot of the descriptions and materials at museums are written for local students. 

So, yeah, I think reading history books is a great way for you to get a better grasp on Vietnamese history. Plus, I believe documentaries and other forms might not convey all the details you need as well as reading can. I just think it’s a really interesting way to learn.",8.5,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230274-2.mp3,CD16_3,2
audio/HUST6923V6BY166/HUST0609230003-3.ogg," So to talk about the topic that museum and art galleries are very important part of our daily life and should be free of charge for students. And we all know museum and arts contain various and big numbers of works and masterpiece from all time to time pass through generations. So first they will have the students to widen their knowledge. This can be developed by time to time through a lot of activities they can spend in museum and art galleries. They need to go there many times in order to get more and more and get to understand the big amount of knowledge they can get in these places. That's why it should be free of charge for students so they can freely go there anytime they have free time after school and they can go there with their friends. And this is why this is one of the reasons to reduce the stress for the students. Students they have to spend a lot of time at their school. So if they have free time they can go to the museum and art galleries with their friends instead of going to their houses to sleep or just basically playing video games. Friends can go to museum and arts to spend their time there relaxing. They can have a lot of fun quits or just hanging around in the good nice quiet atmosphere for them to just relax and retreat themselves or blend into the arts. Sometimes going to museums and art galleries can have students to meet people of the same interest. For example, students when they study arts they have their own type of favorite actors or painters. For example, people with the same interest in Van Gogh can meet in the galleries and they can talk and exchange knowledge that they have while spending time in the galleries or in the museum. I know a lot of students that love to study history but sometimes they don't have companies in their classes so they can talk about it. They can of course find a new friend in the museum who has the same interest and they can furtherly discuss more and become good friends in real life. Other than this good reason, I think museum and arts can bring the real life experience that students cannot have in classes. They don't really have a chance to see the real picture or get to see the real action or situation in the history in just a book. They can definitely see and catch all the feelings. They have learned a school and then go there in the museum they can really understand how the situation is really going in the past. In Vietnam, we have a lot of historical museums not just in Hanoi Ho Chi Minh but for different countries. We go through a lot of walls so for that museum with a very dynamic amount of pictures and material from the world and the history in the past. Normally, children don't really enjoy going to the museum because it costs them a bit much for their tickets.","Okay, so I wanna talk about why museums and art galleries are super important in our daily lives and why they should be free for students. I mean, we all know that museums and art galleries hold a ton of works and masterpieces that have been passed down through generations, right? So like, first off, they help students widen their knowledge. Visiting these places can really develop their understanding over time through all the activities they can do there. It’s really important for them to go back multiple times to soak in all the knowledge available. 

That’s why I think it should be free for students, so they can visit whenever they have time after school, you know? They could go hang out there with their friends instead of just going home to sleep or, like, playing video games. Plus, museums and galleries can help reduce stress for students. They spend so much time at school, and if they have some free time, they can spend it relaxing in a nice quiet place, just enjoying the art and atmosphere. 

And another thing is, there’s a chance for students to meet people who share their interests. Like, if they’re studying art, they might have favorite artists or painters. For instance, fans of Van Gogh might bump into each other in the galleries and get to talk, you know, share what they know while they're there. I mean, I know so many students who love history, but sometimes they don’t have anyone in class to discuss it with. So, they might make new friends at the museum who are into the same things and can have deeper conversations. 

Also, museums and galleries give students real-life experiences that they can't get in the classroom. They don’t really get the chance to see real art or historical situations just by reading from a book. But when they're at a museum, they can really grasp the feelings and understand how things were back in the day. Here in Vietnam, we have loads of historical museums, not just in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City but all over. They feature a ton of pictures and materials showcasing world history. 

But, you know, normally kids don’t enjoy going to museums 'cause of the ticket prices, which can be a bit much for them.",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_1/audio/HUST6923V6BY166/HUST0609230003-3.mp3,CD13_1,3

audio/HUST24223PUF8167/HUST2402230188-3.ogg," It is obvious to see that many, many young people are becoming more violent than they were in the past. And to explain about that, there are many reasons. First of all, it's peer pressure when they see people around them are very good, when they get in trouble with their friend, they will be violent. And the second reason is that they don't have well-educated parents or supervisors. Especially if they get good advice from their parents or if they get well-education from school, or parents, or whatever, they will understand the situation and can overcome the situation by situation easily. But for people lack of education, they will easily get angry and fight with others. And also from social network, like Facebook or Instagram, many young people are, you know, bossing a lot of video to prove that they are good, that they fight each other. It leads to some people think that fighting with others is acceptable. And of course, it causes the rate of violence increasingly. And the effect of violence among the young, it actually that happened from many, many from many, many centuries ago. And violence among the people can definitely kill all the relationship between them. And you know, they will get injury and they will go to the hospital and they will maybe get a deeper result. They will go to the cell or get into many trouble. They will drop out from university or school. And of course, they will get worse than that. But they don't get any good supervisor. To solve this problem, I will suggest some suggestion. As I mentioned before, we have three reasons to cause that violence. And we need also have three solutions for that. The first of all, about peer pressure. We need to take young people to calm down when they have any problem. They don't need to be super competitive. They don't need to be super, don't have any big, like very ambitious target. And then they need to have frequent talk with their parents. Their parents need to respond for any bad result. And the parents should teach them from very young kids. Let them understand the right thing, the wrong thing. And violence is not the good way to solve the problem. And also for their influence. We need to let them have training, for example, to understand that it's not good. And also the police and the government should have action to control the thing on the social network.","Okay, so it's pretty obvious that a lot of young people are becoming more violent than they used to be, right? And, I mean, there are several reasons for this issue. First off, we gotta talk about peer pressure. Like, when they see their friends acting tough or getting into trouble, they might feel like they have to act that way, too. 

Then, another big reason is that some of them just don’t have well-educated parents or good supervisors. If they had better guidance from their parents or teachers, they might understand how to deal with situations differently, you know? But for those who lack education, they can easily blow up and end up fighting with others.

Also, let’s not forget about social media. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram can be pretty negative, I mean, a lot of young folks are posting videos of fights to show off, thinking it’s cool. This kinda makes fighting seem acceptable, which just adds to the problem and raises violence levels. 

And the effects of all this violence, well, they’ve been around for ages. It can definitely ruin relationships between people. You know, it can lead to injuries, hospital visits, and some might even end up in jail. Plus, it can cause them to drop out of school or university, leading to even bigger problems down the line. 

So, to tackle this issue, I've got a few suggestions. Like I said, there are three main reasons causing this violence, and we should have at least three solutions. First, about peer pressure, we need to help young people learn to calm down when they face problems. They don't always need to compete or aim super high. 

Also, it’s important that they talk to their parents regularly. Parents should help them understand the consequences of bad actions. Starting from a young age, they should teach what’s right and wrong, and that violence is not the way to go. 

And then, regarding their influences, we need to provide training or workshops to help them understand that violence isn’t acceptable.

I think that these days, people are taking a lot of actions that they really need to do for our living environment. I mean, like, we see a lot of people driving their cars instead of using public transportation and, you know, using plastic bags and stuff. It’s just, it’s a problem. When too many people use cars, the emissions go up and that just means more air pollution.

In my opinion, there are many ways to help protect the environment in the future. First off, we should really say no to plastic bags. I mean, we should switch to reusable bags, glass containers, and all that. Second, we definitely need to use public transportation more. Like I mentioned, the more we use personal vehicles, the more emissions we’re putting out there. Plus, taking the bus is super cheap; like, a single ticket only costs around 7,000 THB, and it’s even cheaper if you buy multiple tickets.

Also, I think we should look into using alternative energy sources. Like, if you see how much damage is happening to our living environment, it’s pretty serious, right? So yeah, switching to alternative energies is one of the best ways to protect our planet.

And about the last question, I reckon that companies and organizations like BSLIT should be more environmentally friendly because their actions can really impact the environment. So, yeah, that’s what I think!",8.0,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230240-3.mp3,CD16_3,3

I prepare winter because winter is cold and chilly and with winter you can eat when you feel a little bit hot you can easily turn on the heater if you have a heater at home which makes you feel warm for some time. And also during the winter my skin, because of my skin, my skin gets fresh during the winter. Well, I do prefer to live in a cold region because I don't like the hot climate. With the hot climate my body cannot easily adapt to the hot climate so because of that it makes me feel itchy, it makes my body feel dry. So I prefer to live in a cold region because some days it gets a little bit cold and then some days it gets a little bit warm. It's not like in the cold region it rains all the time. It rains sometimes and then other times it's chilly and other times the weather is normal. Okay, question one, talk about body language. Alright, for question one, do you often use body language in communications? Well, sometimes I do use body language in communication especially when I'm hesitant to make a decision and if I don't want to talk so much I prefer to use my body language just to make the person understand that I dislike something or I am a little bit tired of explaining myself to somebody. Most especially the time, the situation where I use body language is when I dislike something and with body language it helps me a lot.","Okay, so let’s chat about the climate in my area. Right now, it's autumn, and I’m kinda preparing for winter 'cause winter can be really cold and chilly. You know, during winter, if you ever feel a bit cold, you can just turn on the heater if you have one, and it makes you feel warm for a while. Also, I’ve noticed my skin gets kinda fresh in winter, which is nice! 

Honestly, I really prefer living in a colder place 'cause I’m not a fan of hot weather at all. With the heat, my body just can’t adapt well, so I tend to feel itchy and my skin gets all dry. So, cold regions are better for me. It’s not like it rains all the time, though. Some days it gets a bit cold, then other days it's warmer, and it’s just like a mix, which is fine. 

Alright, moving on to question one about body language. So, do I often use body language when I communicate? Yeah, I do sometimes! Especially when I'm unsure about something or when I don’t wanna talk too much. I kinda lean on my body language to let the other person know if I’m not feeling something or if I’m a bit tired of explaining myself.

In my opinion, in a restaurant is the best option because of the following reason. Firstly, it is convenient and useful. You have eaten a good meal in the restaurant. Besides, it is suitable. You don't have to clean your house or you don't have any. I don't choose another option because as someone's house, you have to clean the house after the party. It is not a good choice. Secondly, it is not useful and it is inconvenient. To sum up, in this situation, I will choose to organize the party at the end of the semester as one student house for this about reason. That's all.

I don’t really want to go for another option, like having it at someone’s house, 'cause then you have to deal with all that cleaning after the party. That can be such a hassle, right? So, yeah, a restaurant just makes way more sense. 

To sum it up, I think the best plan is to organize the party at a restaurant at the end of the semester, and that’s the reason I’ll stick to that choice. So, that's all I have to say!

I think it's the best way to help me really just after a long day at school. Question number two. Where would you like to go for an evening course? So, in my mind, I think I frequently go to the parks with my friends because when I come to the park with my friends, I can say my story and sometimes I also turn on my favorite music and release. Question number three. What are the benefits of an evening course? Well, I think firstly, benefits of an evening course is we can really just after a long day at school. And secondly, it also help me improve my health, like physical health or mental health. Topic number three. Today I'm going to talk about writing postcards. Have you ever writing postcards? Well, I think no. When I'm a little boy, I also have time reading postcards. But I think I feel it's not suitable for me. And when I grow up, I think when it's also important, but I still cannot write postcards. Question number two. Who did you send a postcard to?

Now, question three, what are the benefits of an evening course? I’d say, first off, one big benefit is that it really helps us relax after a stressful day at school. And secondly, it can really help with my health, you know, both physical and mental health.

So, the next topic is about writing postcards. Have you ever written postcards? Well, honestly, I think I haven’t really written postcards. When I was a little kid, I had a time when I read postcards, but it just didn’t feel right for me. And, you know, now that I'm older, I still think it's important, but I still struggle with writing them.

I would like to work in the morning because at night our body produces a lot of hormones and antiviruses just to strengthen our immune system in the night. It would not be wise to work in the night. In the morning, I always feel more productive and hardworking as my mind is fresh. I always like to work after breakfast and morning coffee. It depends on the person, audience and body to choose which is the right answer, morning or night. However, for me, it's definitely morning. I would prefer to work as part of the team because I am an extrovert, so I don't have difficulty to communicate with other people. Working as a team extracts the best hours. It makes the production significantly higher and it would make everyone have the benefit in it. It's not like working individually while you have the focus of working alone. You don't gather the strength of anybody around. If there is no strength being allocated and waste, then it would be a waste to not use those strengths. Normally, I would like to work with people who are hardworking, passionate and creative. To work with hardworking people, they would lose their fair share of jobs. I don't have to do the burden of taking other work to myself. If my partner is passionate and creative, they will come up with brilliant, excellent ideas when working. It would make the productivity significantly higher. If I have to work alone, I would prefer to consult with others before work.","Okay, so, I wanna talk about how I’m more of a morning person, you know? I always feel like I work better in the morning.

In the morning, I feel super productive and my mind is just fresh, which is great. I usually like to get things done after I have my breakfast and morning coffee. But I get that some people are night owls, so it really depends on the person and how their body works. For me, though, mornings are definitely the way to go.

And, you know, I really enjoy working as part of a team because I’m an extrovert. I don’t have trouble talking to people, and I think that working together brings out the best in everyone. It makes the output way better than if you’re working alone, you know? When you’re on your own, you're not really tapping into the strengths of others around you, and that feels like such a waste.

When it comes to teamwork, I really like working with people who are hardworking, passionate, and creative, you know? If my teammates are dedicated, it means I don’t have to pick up their slack. And if they’re passionate and creative, they come up with awesome ideas that make the whole project better.

I think it's the best for a broader picture because it lasts longer than the two other options and also as the foreign teacher may be travelling by plane a conical ad as cool as it is may be a bit bothering when you're taking the plane and you already have like a lot of luggage. A picture can fit easily in a bag so would be a very nice gift. Then again which the I mean just three options shows that like they're both three options are a good representation of what Vietnam does very good. So I think that out of three options like the picture would be the best because like it can also represent a Vietnamese scenery or something like this like I can totally picture something very beautiful with some rice field and water buffalo and those kind of things. It would be a very sweet memories for your teacher to look at every time you were a gaze in his living room and it would be also a good thing to show his friends and talk about and what helps export the beauty of Vietnam in another place and for sure be a delightful memory for the teacher. I mean the coffee would be really nice too as Vietnamese coffee is so delicious but it doesn't last too long. I mean it would be kind of sad when it would run out of it and as I said before the conical hat just for practical I think is not the best.","Okay, so when it comes to the best gift for a foreign teacher, I think a picture is really the best choice.

It can easily fit into a bag, so that makes it a really nice gift.

So, I mean, all three options represent Vietnam really well, but I really think the picture stands out. It could showcase some beautiful Vietnamese scenery, like rice fields or water buffaloes or something. Just imagine how sweet it would be for the teacher to look at that every time he walks into his living room. It’d also be a great conversation starter with his friends, you know? It helps export the beauty of Vietnam to another place, and that would definitely be a delightful memory for him.

Now, don't get me wrong, Vietnamese coffee is super delicious, and that would make a nice gift too, but it doesn’t last long. It would be kind of sad when it runs out, right?

audio/HUST4423NA1U177/HUST0404230012-3.ogg," Nowadays, people prefer fast food and young food due to the benefits. First of all, they tend to consume fast food because they can save time. It can be explained by that these days, people are always busy with their work at work place or students are very busy with their studying schedule. So they have no time to prepare a homemade meal. So they have to buy fast food. Another advantage of consuming fast food is saving money. People believe that it's more economical to buy fast food rather than to buy fast food. They can make a meal or cook a meal at home because instead of buying a variety of different ingredients at the supermarket or at the market, people just buy one pack of bread or hamburger at the fast food or at the restaurant so they can save a lot of money from that. Last but not least, people like eating fast food because it's a good taste. In fast food, it contains all kinds of savory, chaletarone, and fat with different delicious flavors. It easily appeals to their customer taste. I think people working in an office tend to consume more fast food because they have no time to commute from their workplace to their home to prepare a fast food. Of course, fast food has trained people eating habits in the past few years because in the past, people hated the habit of making a meal and enjoying it with their family members. However, there are some disadvantages of eating fast food. Eating fast food too much is not good for our health.","Okay, so today, I wanna talk about why people are, like, really into fast food, especially young folks. First off, you know, they really love fast food 'cause it saves a ton of time. I mean, these days, everyone’s super busy with work or students are just swamped with their study schedules, right? So, they barely have time to whip up a homemade meal. That’s why grabbing fast food is kinda the go-to option.

Another thing is that fast food can be a money-saver. Like, a lot of people think it’s cheaper to buy fast food than to cook at home. 'Cause, instead of spending cash on a bunch of different ingredients at the grocery store, they just grab a burger or a pack of fries from fast food places. It’s just easier on their wallets, you know?

And, you know, let’s not forget, fast food is also super tasty! It’s got all those savory flavors, lots of fats, and they make it really delicious, so it’s hard to resist. I think people working in offices are especially into fast food 'cause they don’t wanna waste time commuting back home just to cook a meal.

But, yeah, fast food has definitely changed how people eat over the past few years. I mean, there was a time when folks enjoyed cooking and sharing meals with their families, but now it’s kinda shifted. However, we gotta be real, there are downsides to eating fast food too. Like, if you have it too much, it’s really not great for our health.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U177/HUST0404230012-3.mp3,CD8_1,3

It's not a big amount of money, but it's also something that is worthwhile for us to discuss how we can spend it. I do not think buying a new TV is necessary because still we have a very good functioning one at home at the moment. We do not need a new one, an extra one, because I do not think spending time with TV is a nice way of spending time together. I do not think that we should keep it in a bank because that money is too little for us. It will not help us to pay whatever bill that we're going to have in the future. It's just a very small amount. It also does not make sense because the interest is generated from that small amount of money. It's also not substantial at all for us to even consider that option. The most wonderful thing I think we should spend money on is going for a holiday. That's just sufficient for our two or three days holiday being away from this busy city life. It has been quite a while. I think six weeks already that we haven't gone anywhere out of the cities and having quality time together. I think this has just come at the right time for us as a nice surprise as well to really escape from this city life for a while. To enjoy this special moment, to enjoy this special luck. It's not talking about the money amount, but the luck that we get with gaining this luxury. It's the first time in our life. So going on a holiday, we can spend time together. We can really enjoy the fresh air outside the city, exploring new things, testing new food, knowing new people. We can fully enjoy the moment we have together. Who knows, maybe when going out somewhere, we will get a chance to expand our knowledge, our contacts, our network. That will easily come back to us with a chance of getting more money in the future. I want to spend it for the whole day.","Okay, so it's really exciting that we just won a lottery of ten million Vietnamese dong. I mean, it's not a huge amount of money, but it's definitely enough for us to chat about how to spend it, you know? I don't think buying a new TV is necessary since we already have a good one at home. We really don't need an extra TV, and honestly, spending time watching TV isn't a great way to bond together. 

Also, I would say keeping it in a bank isn’t a good idea either because, let’s be honest, that amount is just too small to make a difference with bills we might have coming up. It won't really help us much, and the interest we’d earn on such a little amount is pretty much nothing. So, that option doesn't make much sense at all. 

What I think we should do is spend the money on a holiday. It would be perfect for a two or three-day getaway from all the craziness of city life. You know, it’s been, like, six weeks since we’ve gone anywhere, and I think it’s time for some quality time together. This little surprise of winning is just what we need to escape the city for a bit, to enjoy and appreciate this lucky moment. 

It’s not really about the money itself, but more about the luck we’ve had and this new experience. Going on a holiday means we can spend time together, breathe in some fresh air outside the city, try new foods, and meet new people. We'll really get to enjoy our time and who knows, maybe we’ll even learn something new or make new connections while we’re out there. That could open up even more opportunities for us in the future!

I think that a plant can be worth to call a gift. He can also choose a plant or flower that can be a symbol of the mother and son's relationship. It's a very good way to love her. I think that it's a very good and easy way for him to show his love to his mother. It's not so easy to say that out loud, it's worse. I think that his mother is the kind of person that loves vegetables and loves doing the garden. So a plant is really appropriate. About the photo of the perfume. Firstly, I don't think a good perfume will be fit the budget of our students. Secondly, to choose a perfume, you have to have some knowledge. It can be a spray on your body, it can be a spray on our body, our neck. So it will be difficult to choose and it's important to choose a perfume that will not affect your health. About the last option, a piece of kitchenware. I think that this is some kind of a thing that you can give to your mother in a normal day. It doesn't have to be her birthday. Kitchenware is a thing that will belong to the daily life. So I think he can give her in any normal day. In conclusion, I think that choosing a plant, flower as a birthday gift will be the best choice. Thank you.","Alright, so if my friend asked me what gift to get for his mom's birthday, I'd totally suggest he buy a plant. I mean, a plant can really be a nice gift, you know? He could pick a plant or even some flowers that kinda symbolize their relationship, which I think is a sweet way to show love. It’s not always easy to express those feelings out loud, and I get that. But if his mom loves gardening and is into veggies, then a plant would definitely be the right choice.

Now, when it comes to perfume, I'm not really sure that's a good fit. First off, a decent perfume might be kinda pricey for a student’s budget. Plus, picking a perfume is tricky 'cause you gotta know a bit about scents and stuff. I mean, you don’t just spray it anywhere; it goes on your body, like your neck or wrists. And you wanna make sure it’s something that won't mess with her health, right?

Now, as for kitchenware, I think that’s more of a casual gift. Like, it’s the kinda thing you can give any day, not just on her birthday. Kitchenware's more about daily life, you know?

I really think a dictionary can be super helpful.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_2/audio/HUST24223PUF8177/HUST2402230119-1.mp3,CD7_2,1

Husband and wife play an important role to build up families. Husband and wife should have equal roles in the family for some reasons. Firstly, when they have equal partnership, they can share more routine household tasks like cooking, wash the dishes, clean the floor, wipe the floor, wash the clothes, do washing machine like that, and especially take care of the baby. If only women or men do all the work, it will make them very difficult to deal with all the things they have to do. So they should share the routine in household tasks. They could help each other to do with it. And it helps the family be connected to each other. The women have some time to do anything else. And secondly, they can share childcare responsibilities. The child needs both mother and father's education to educate them because the child will be fully grown with their parents supported, not only in school, not only with their friends, but also with their parents. So when equal partnership, they can share with each other how to help their child grow efficiently. Thirdly, with equal partnership in the family, they can work as a team. The sheep can go forward to the target if they are together the same mind. And people said, one sentence like, with only single can do a little thing, but with a team, we can do a lot of more things. So as a team, they can overcome the difficulty of life and built up a happy life. In conclusion, I think in family with equal partnership between husband and wife play very important role as share more routine household tasks, share childcare responsibilities and work as a team. Single parent family become more common, but I think that is it.","Okay, so, today I wanna talk about the importance of husbands and wives in building strong families, especially in Vietnam. You know, I really think they play a huge role in this. It’s super important for them to have equal roles in the family, and let me tell you why.

Firstly, when there’s equal partnership, they can share the everyday household tasks, like cooking, washing the dishes, cleaning the floor, doing laundry, you know, all that stuff. And especially, they really need to co-parent the kids. If only one person is doing all the work, it can get really overwhelming for them. So, by sharing those tasks, they can help each other out and it makes the whole family feel more connected. Plus, this way, the woman gets some time to do other things too.

Then, the second point is about sharing childcare responsibilities. Kids really need both a mom and a dad to help them grow up. It’s not just about what they learn at school or from friends; having support from both parents is key. So, with an equal partnership, they can work together to help their child develop in a healthy way.

And lastly, with the husband and wife being equal partners, they can work as a team. You know, when they’re on the same page, they can aim for their goals together. There’s a saying that goes something like, “One can only do so little, but a team can achieve so much more.” So, as a team, they can get through tough times and really build a happy life together.

In conclusion, I just think that having equal partnership between husbands and wives is super important. They can share household tasks, handle childcare together, and work as a team. Sure, single-parent families are becoming more common, but I think there's just something special about having both parents involved.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U167/HUST0404230093-3.mp3,CD8_1,3

I like to ask them about life skills, about their experience. They have to need to get along with that. And dating is not around relationships. It's making friends. Take it easy. In the past, I just dated with one guy. He's my ex-boyfriend. He is a good person, but I don't like him anymore. When I have a first date, the things I prepare is a look-up here. I like to make up and dress on. I just want to make a horse when I have a date with someone. When I fail to play with him, I make him more confident and look more gorgeous. Just prepare with him and be patient with him. And next to the questions, I'm not often listening to radio. In the past, when my grandma still lives, my grandma likes to listen to radio. But I'm a teenager. Zendre right now. Zendre right now has smartphones and AirPods. It's easy to listen when hanging around in the street. Radio channel I remember is the rabbit in the YouTube. They talk about the nation and tell a lot of story before you get to sleep. And the benefit of listening to radio, I think you can focus on what they say. And get a note to prepare anything you're listening to on the radio.","Okay, so for these questions, I'm definitely someone who loves to hang out and make friends with a lot of people, you know? A big reason why I do this is 'cause I like to ask them about life skills and their experiences. I mean, it’s not just about dating and relationships; for me, it’s about making friends. I take it easy. 

In the past, I only dated one guy, he was my ex-boyfriend. He’s a good person, but honestly, I don’t like him anymore. When I go on a first date, I usually prepare, like, how I look. I enjoy putting on makeup and dressing up. I want to feel confident and look good when I’m with someone. I think that when I look good, it kinda makes him feel more confident too, and you know, it just helps the vibe. So, I try to prepare well and be patient.

Now, about listening to the radio—I'm not really into that these days. Back when my grandma was still alive, she loved listening to the radio. But now, being a teenager, everything’s changed, right? We have smartphones and AirPods, so it's way easier to listen to stuff while I'm out and about. 

One radio channel I remember is this one called ""The Rabbit"" on YouTube. They talk about different topics and share stories, which is nice, especially before going to sleep. I think one benefit of listening to the radio is that you can really focus on what they’re saying and take notes on whatever you’re listening to.

And there are three ways or three measures to communicate with her, like writing emails, sending text messages, or talking in person. Before I have to choose one of these options, I would like to talk about all of these three measures. So firstly, writing emails is a possible, absolutely a polite way to talk about or about the tidy up the office. I suggest her to tidy up the office, but there's a problem with my colleague. She is really busy or stuck in the workload, so I don't think that she can see or she can check the email. And in another issue, the email can go directly into the trash or the trash so she can see it. And in terms of the text message, yes, I can send it to her, but she is stuck in the workload and she is really busy, so I don't think she can check it. And the text message is quite a convenient way nowadays, but I also think that she may be distracted by another message instead of my mind. And in terms of talking in person, yes, I do believe that this is the best option for me because I and my colleagues can get along well with each other. So it's comfortable and the best way for us to share the ideas so I can suggest or I can talk with her face to face. She is quite a friendly and sociable person and also an outgoing person. And she is a positive one to receive advice from anyone, so I don't think that writing emails or texting messages is the best way for me. And after considering three texts, I choose to take them.","Okay, so I wanna talk about a little issue I have at work. You know, my colleagues never really tidy up the office, and I'd like to discuss this problem with one of them. And there are basically three ways I could communicate with her: like writing an email, sending a text message, or, you know, talking to her in person. 

So, before I pick one of these options, let me just go through all three. First, writing an email—yeah, that's definitely a polite way to address the office tidiness. I could suggest that she tidy things up, but there’s a catch: she’s usually super busy and kinda swamped with work, so I’m not sure she’d actually check the email. Plus, there's always a chance it could end up in her spam or just be ignored, you know?

Then there’s the text message option. I could totally send her a text, but, again, she’s busy, right? So I doubt she’d pay much attention to it either. Even though texting is pretty convenient these days, she might just get distracted by other messages and miss mine.

Now, talking in person—that seems like the best choice for me. I mean, we get along well, so it’s kinda comfortable to share ideas that way. Plus, she’s really friendly and sociable; she’s the type who’s open to advice or suggestions. So, I really don't think an email or a text is gonna cut it, to be honest. 

So after thinking about all three options, I’m definitely leaning toward having a face-to-face chat with her.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_3/audio/HUST44237SIU167/HUST0404230281-2.mp3,CD8_3,2

Something like compliment is a good way to motivate students to learn English. When students gain a better score, gain knowledge about the lesson, the teacher should give her or him a compliment or gift present to motivate them to evoke their brain. The game good for English lesson should be efficient to motivate students to learn English. The game good for English lesson should be efficient to motivate students to learn English. In that level, people study English by image or photo and design the game, design the lesson plan with many images and games. It is a good way to motivate students to learn English and to give their attention to the lesson. If the lesson is attractive, the children will gain more knowledge about the lesson. Another thing that the game good for English learning is that if the traditional lesson plan, people feel bored and depressed about the lesson. The children should start learning English as they start learning English. If you have English language, it will be better. If you have English language, it will be better.","Alright, so I think there are a lot of activities that should happen in class to motivate students to learn English, you know? Like, games or engaging lessons, that kinda thing. I mean, giving compliments is also a really good way to motivate them. So, when students do well, like they get a better score or really learn something, the teacher should definitely give them a compliment or maybe a small gift to encourage them. It’s all about getting their brains working, right?

And you know, games for English lessons should really be effective to keep the students interested. Like, at a certain level, people can learn English through images or photos, and then they can design games and lesson plans that include lots of visuals. That’s a great way to grab students' attention and help them learn better. If the lessons are fun and engaging, kids are gonna absorb so much more information.

But, if we stick to traditional lesson plans, like the boring ones, students might feel kinda bored and down about the whole thing. So, I think kids should start learning English in a fun way from the get-go.

But if you want to go with prom, that would definitely be my best friend. Because you know, having a best friend beside you for the graduation night, the night that is most memorable to you and would be something you look forward, you will look back in the future. Having a best friend besides me is something I really want to do when in graduations. And you know, we can go out together before the graduation night, attend before the prom of course. And having more of a girls night and dancing together, mainly because I don't have a boyfriend to go to. So instead of going to a strangers and being awkwardly, awkwardly dancing and talking together through the night, I would rather go with something I'm most used to, like my best friend. The best choice, the reason, the most reason why I think she's the best choice is because she is a very extroverted person and I'm more introverted and more with subtle aims and less talkative than her. So having her beside me is like her reading my thoughts to others, her reading my thoughts and expressing it to the others so that I don't have to communicate much. I'm going to say I don't like people, but I poorly interact with people and through the night, she will be more supportive if I want to dance with others and I will be supportive if she doesn't want to go with me and I want to go with her significant others, but I know that she don't have, so I will stick to her if she bans me for other people, I will not be upset. And enjoying the night with your friends, enjoy the night with your college mate is something that will make memorable and fascinating experiences and not knowledge, but more like an ideal prom night to me.","Okay, so, like, going to prom isn’t really something I experienced in college or even in high school or middle school, you know? But if I were to go to a prom, I would definitely want to go with my best friend. I mean, having your best friend with you on graduation night, which is, like, super memorable, is just what I’d look forward to and remember in the future. It’s just something I really want, especially for graduation. 

And, you know, we could hang out before the prom, like maybe have a girls' night and dance together, 'cause honestly, I don't have a boyfriend to go with. Instead of, like, awkwardly dancing with some random guy and making small talk all night, I’d much rather go with someone I’m comfortable with, like my best friend. 

The biggest reason I think she’s the best choice is 'cause she’s really extroverted, while I’m more of an introvert, you know? I’m kind of less talkative than her, so it’s nice having her around because she sort of reads my thoughts and expresses them to others for me, which helps a lot. I’m not saying I don’t like people, but I just don’t interact well sometimes. 

So, if I want to dance with someone, she’ll totally support me, and if she wants to chill or doesn’t feel like going out, that’s cool too. Plus, I know she doesn’t have a significant other to be with, so it’s like we can just stick together without any drama.

It's quite a bit minor in my field. I am now the master at my major, which is called Master in Clinical Psychology. After six years of studying and taking into practice, I find there are many difficulties and challenges in my studies. The most one, I think, it could be the lack of resources about the literature. The second one is about the barriers in communication and in language transformation. After my graduation, I tend to have three directions and orientation about my major. First, I would choose to have a PhD in psychology. After getting the PhD degree, I have the orientation to become a lecturer in my faculty. And then, after I get enough resources and financial abilities, I would open my own center for psychological therapy. And my last desire to achieve in this field and also my major is that I could be an independent researcher so that I can fulfill and implement the research foundation and theoretical base of psychology research in Vietnam. So, I don't know whether I have to talk about my leisure time, but I choose the first topic. So, I only have 30 seconds left. I don't know if I have to talk about this or not, but I don't have any fixed interest to do in my free time. And, ultimately, I play guitar in my free time, so... hmm... and I choose to spend my free time alone rather than being with another person.","Okay, so let’s talk a little bit about my major at university. First off, my name’s Li Ming, but you can just call me Ming. So, I’m majoring in psychology, which is pretty interesting. Right now, I’m working on my Master’s in Clinical Psychology. I’ve been studying for about six years, and honestly, it’s been a bit tough with some challenges along the way. 

One of the biggest challenges I face, I think, is the lack of resources when it comes to literature. And then there’s also the whole communication barrier and language transition thing. After I graduate, I’ve got a few paths I’m considering for the future. First, I'm thinking about pursuing a PhD in psychology. Once I get that, my goal is to become a lecturer at my faculty. 

Then, once I have enough resources and can manage financially, I’d love to open my own center for psychological therapy. And, my ultimate dream in this field is to become an independent researcher. I really want to build and contribute to the theoretical foundation of psychology research here in Vietnam. 

I’m not sure if I should mention what I do in my free time, but I’ll just go with it. I only have like 30 seconds left anyway. So, I don’t really have a fixed hobby or anything, but I do play guitar. I usually prefer to spend my free time alone rather than hanging out with other people.

audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230017-3.ogg," Private cars are a big problem in big cities. One problem is that we call traffic jams. For example, in Vietnam, there used to be only motorcycle and bicycle, so the road is very easy for transmute. But when more and more people buy cars, we call a lot of traffic jams since a car will take place on the road for 4 and even 5 motorcycle. Another problem is environmental pollution or air pollution specifically. Since many people choose private cars, there are only one car and one person, and you multiply it with a thousand, even hundred thousand people go to the road. It will expose a lot of gas and affect the environment greatly. There are also problems about exhaustion from the vehicle, the cars. The price of the car is very huge, it will likely be a fortune for the family. Sometimes you won't use it because you only use it to go to the countryside, to the hometown. But because the transmute in the city has a lot of traffic jams, you don't use your car in your city and it's a big waste of money. Another problem with private cars is that it will obstruct the development of public vehicles. Because the bus cannot go freely since they are stuck within thousand and thousand cars every day. And since people have their own cars, they are less likely to choose public vehicles. I think the reason why most people prefer to drive their own cars is that one of the things is from the public transport. Because the train, for example, when I went to go from the north to the middle, you can get on the train, but the train is very slow, the quality is very bad. However, the government has developed a lot of freeways and it's easier to go with cars rather than trains. You can consider about travel by airplanes, but the price is high and it's difficult to bring a lot of goods or bring your family on an airplane rather than a car. So in my place, I think the means of public transport that should be developed is for train stations. Because the train station won't have problems with traffic jams, it is more likely for people to choose this. There is some development in city trains in my city and hopefully in the future, they will be more and more developed. About public transport being free, I think it's not sufficient to make public transport free. Because people can still choose between public transport and also their private vehicles. And when people are thinking to make something free, it will take a lot of time. When you try to take it for public transport, it will take less time to develop a transport system.","Okay, so I wanna talk about private cars and how they’re like a big problem in big cities. One main issue is traffic jams, you know? Like, in Vietnam, there used to be mostly motorcycles and bicycles, so the roads were pretty easy to get around. But now, with more and more people buying cars, we’re seeing a ton of traffic jams because, like, one car takes up the space of four or even five motorcycles.

Another big problem is environmental pollution, especially air pollution. When lots of people choose to drive their own cars, we just end up with, like, one car for one person, and if you multiply that by thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people, it really adds up. All those cars release a lot of gas, and that definitely impacts the environment a lot. 

And then there’s the issue of car exhaust, right? Plus, the price of cars is super high, so, like, it can cost a fortune for families. Sometimes, people might not even use their cars much, like, maybe just to go to the countryside or their hometown. But with all the traffic jams in the city, a lot of times, they end up not using their cars, so it's kind of a waste of money, you know?

Another downside to private cars is that they obstruct the development of public transport. Buses can’t move freely because they’re stuck among thousands of other cars every single day. Plus, when people have their own cars, they’re less likely to use public transportation.

So, I think one reason why many people prefer driving their own cars is because public transport, like, isn’t always great. For example, if you wanna travel from the north to the middle of the country, you can take a train, but honestly, the trains are really slow and in bad shape. Plus, the government has worked on building more freeways which makes it easier to just drive instead of taking a train.

There’s also flying, but tickets can be pretty expensive, and it’s tough to carry a lot of stuff or travel with family on a plane compared to a car. 

In my opinion, one public transport option that should definitely get more development is the train stations. Trains won’t have to deal with traffic jams, so they’d be more appealing to people. There’s been some progress with city trains in my area, and hopefully, they’ll keep developing more in the future.

And about making public transport free, I don’t think it really solves the problem. People will still have a choice between using public transport and their own cars. Plus, when people think about free stuff, it usually takes a long time to make it happen. So, really, improving the public transport system would probably take less time and be more effective.",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_1/audio/HUST4523I2KC177/HUST0405230017-3.mp3,CD9_1,3

Now, I didn't pick the other two options for a couple of reasons. Like, a bottle of perfume can be super pricey, and it’s kinda out of our budget. Plus, there are so many different scents, it's really tricky to choose one. We just don’t know what smell she likes, you know? 

Then there's the kitchenware. I mean, it sounds interesting, but I really don’t think it’s the best fit. It’s not that useful, and if she doesn’t like it, it's a hassle to return or change. Plus, shipping costs can really add up, and it takes forever to arrive.

So, yeah, to sum it all up, I really believe that a plant is the most suitable gift for her, and that’s why I’m voting for it. Thanks for listening!",8.5,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD13_5/audio/HUST6923VNQJ166/HUST0609230423-2.mp3,CD13_5,2

This is because I'm into the minimalism concept. I believe that everyone in my country like redecorating their homes because they want to have a new appearance from their sweet tea accommodations. This year, I think the trend of decorating new homes as I've concerned before is a simple and minimalism concept. About advertisement, frankly speaking, I'm not a big fan of watching advertisements because I find it very disturbing when it pops up on my screen when I'm working or sending emails. But I admit that I have many times bought something because of seeing an advertisement on the internet. Like because the poster of the product that they advertise is very eye-catching with colorful patterns and the product is so beautiful. For example, when I'm surfing the internet, I'm scrolling on Facebook or other platforms like Shopee or Lazada. I find any beautiful manufacturers products on it. So I just click on buying them. For me, to be a good advertisement, it would contain the nearly perfect appearance or the performance of this product. And it maybe shows the uses or the benefits of that product so that the customer can follow and achieve something when they buy them.","Okay, so I really love decorating my home, and if I had to pick a favorite color, it would definitely be something neutral, like beige, white, brown, or gray.

This year, I think the trend, like I mentioned before, is all about simple and minimalistic styles.

Now, about ads, to be honest, I’m not a huge fan of them. I find them kinda annoying, especially when they just pop up on my screen while I’m, like, working or sending emails, you know? But I gotta admit, I’ve bought stuff a bunch of times just because I saw an ad online. I mean, sometimes the posters for those products are super eye-catching, with all these colorful patterns, and the items look really nice! For example, when I'm scrolling through Facebook or platforms like Shopee or Lazada, I come across these beautiful products, and I just can't help but click and buy.

So, I think a good ad should show off the product in a really appealing way, like how it looks and how it performs. It should definitely highlight the uses and benefits of the product too, so customers can see what they'll gain if they decide to buy it, you know?",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF166/HUST3110230202-1.mp3,CD16_3,1

So which one is the best choice for me? I think it will be swimming pool because I'm a woman and I really enjoy swimming. It can take me to balance my health and keep me fit and lean body. Another advantage of swimming pool is that it can help me connect with the people and the neighbors. And we can make the connection with them. So if we have friends to make exercise together, that will be much more enjoyable when you are doing exercise. And it can broaden your connection. Another thing is great when you are taking swimming pool. I can say that it's not very expensive. It doesn't cost you a leg. And swimming pool costs in Hanoi city in Vietnam is not much more costly.

I usually choose someone in the classroom who he or she is comfortable working with and most of the time that weak student would choose a classmate, an excellent classmate. So I usually give instruction to the stronger student, that classmate who will be paired with a weaker classmate and instruct that student what to do and how to help the classmate. So usually they would work together, be comfortable with each other by talking and by discussing the lesson with each other. So most of the time I would go there to check up on them but I would ask if it is a Vietnamese student, if I am in a Vietnamese classroom, I would ask my AT to ask and to check up on them from time to time.

I try to check on them a lot, and if it’s, like, a Vietnamese student, when I’m in a Vietnamese classroom, I’ll ask my assistant teacher to check in on them too, just to make sure everything’s going okay.

There are a lot of people, and sometimes the quality is just terrible, like the air conditioning and stuff. But I really support public transport, you know?

audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230104-3.ogg," So right now many people and many students in Hanoi choosing the hostel. University students choose the hostel instead of the dormitories. It's because of many advantage. The first one is the adaptability. When in the dorm you have to limit the restrictions on time. But in the bus living in the hostel you have never got the time to go back to your house. So for example, every university student always takes a part-time job to support their finance. And they don't have in the daytime they have to go to the school to have a lesson on the class. They usually just take a part-time job late at night. And when you finish the part-time job the time is over. The time is the restriction on the dormitory. However if you choose the hostel you can go anywhere anytime when you finish the part-time job. And the second is the networking. So actually in many cities the dormitory will be located far from their universities. So actually choosing a hostel that is suitable for both the way to go to the university and also to go to take the part-time job is suitable, is the most suitable. However, the living in the hostel has still some disadvantages. Because it doesn't require you live with a group of people so it will take more money than living in the dormitory in universities. Like it's even higher, five or ten times higher than the money you have to pay per month in the dormitories. And that's also the worst disadvantage of living in the hostel. I mean university students don't have much money like the workers so they don't sometimes they can afford for the high rent money in the hostel.","Okay, so right now, a lot of students in Hanoi are choosing to live in hostels instead of dormitories. And, you know, there are a bunch of advantages to that. The first one is adaptability. Like, in a dorm, you have a lot of rules, especially about when you can come and go. But if you're living in a hostel, you can really come and go as you please, which is super convenient. 

So, for example, every university student pretty much has a part-time job to help with their finances, right? And during the day, they’re usually in classes. Most of the time, they only work at night. So, when they finish their part-time job, it might be late, and that can be a problem if they're in a dorm with strict curfews. But with a hostel, they can just leave whenever they're done with work.

The second point is networking. In many cities, dormitories can be pretty far from the universities, right? So, picking a hostel that’s close to both the school and their part-time jobs just makes sense. 

But, you know, living in a hostel does come with some downsides. Like, you often have to share the space with more people, and that can make it way more expensive than dorm living. Sometimes, it can even cost five to ten times more than staying in a university dorm. And that’s kind of the biggest downside to living in a hostel. I mean, university students don’t usually have as much money as, like, full-time workers do, so sometimes they just can't afford those higher rents in a hostel.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD11_1/audio/HUST6723H9GJ177/HUST0607230104-3.mp3,CD11_1,3

Firstly, I think that making a class photo album is very easy to make because we are normal people and we are not professional models. So we need to make a class photo album that is very warm and cozy and it can keep the memories of our student life. Another reason is that a class photo album can be kept for a very long time because after we photograph a photo album, we will create a physical design of that album which can be kept for a very long time. And finally, I think that making a class photo album doesn't cost much money because we just graduated students and we don't have much money. I think that making a class photo album will make it affordable to make a photo album. On the other hand, I think that designing a class uniform is not a suitable option because of the fact that we are not professional designers. And I also think that we can hire a class uniform to make a class photo album later. And furthermore, it seems to me that producing a class video is not a reasonable choice either since it contains a great deal of brainstorms. We have to think a lot to make a good video so I don't think that it will be suitable for us. I think that's a sum up of all the...","Okay, so if I had to pick one option out of three—designing a class uniform, making a class photo album, or producing a class video—I would go with making a class photo album, and here’s why. First off, I think creating a photo album is really easy to do. I mean, we’re all just regular students, not professional models or anything, right? So, a photo album would feel warm and cozy, and it’d help keep those memories of our student life alive.

Another reason is that a class photo album can last a long time. After we take the pictures, we’ll be designing a physical album that we can hang onto for years. And finally, making a class photo album is pretty cost-effective too, since we’re just fresh graduates and, you know, we don’t have much money to spare. So, yeah, a photo album would be super affordable.

Now, on the flip side, I feel like designing a class uniform isn't a great option because, let’s face it, we’re not professional designers. And honestly, we could always just hire someone to help with the uniform later, if needed. Plus, producing a class video doesn’t seem very reasonable either, since it involves a lot of brainstorming and planning, and I just don’t think we’re set up for that right now.

Therefore, going on a diet is important and a good solution for us to do when we want to lose some weight. One of the key factors when we want to lose some weight is that we have to eat, we have to consider and control the amount of food that we take in. In detail, we have to control the amount of calories. We have to take in every meal. In order to reduce the amount of calories, we have to control the size of each meal portion. By going on a diet, not only in order to lose weight, we have to make sure that the total amount of food is not too much. In addition, we have to be sure that the food must be healthy. Our meal should include vegetable and high protein foods. Some high fat foods should be controlled or banned in our daily meals if we want to lose the weight. In order to have a balanced diet, we have to make sure that we have to take in or drink enough food or drink enough water. The amount appropriate for each person drink every day is around 1.5 liters. Going on a diet","Okay, so, when it comes to losing weight, what we eat is super important. I mean, going on a diet can really be a good solution if we wanna shed some pounds. One main thing to keep in mind is we’ve gotta think about and control how much food we’re taking in. Like, we really need to watch our calorie intake with every meal.

So, to cut down on calories, it’s crucial to pay attention to the portion sizes of what we eat. And it's not just about losing weight; we gotta make sure we're not overloading on food either. Plus, it's really important that the food we eat is healthy. Our meals should include plenty of vegetables and high-protein foods. It’s, you know, best to keep high-fat foods to a minimum or just totally cut them out if we wanna lose weight.

Also, to keep a balanced diet, we need to make sure we’re drinking enough water. The right amount for most people is around 1.5 liters a day.

To be honest, I am a girl so I prefer working with female boys to male because I think female boys are more understood. She also knows about their advantages and disadvantages when working.

The reason being, when coming to the gym, she would be able to workout. Almost every gym will have a personal trainer or PE to help everyone during their workout. They can also have with the diet, they could also have with the training routine, like what should she do and how should she do it. Also, just being a vegetarian doesn't always mean being more healthy because people need a lot of different substance to keep them being healthy. Also, running 3 km in the morning is just a random thought at the moment for her. She might or might not be able to do it and even if she can't do it regularly, it doesn't always guarantee getting healthier. So, for me, going to the gym should also help her with the other two options. She can have a PE, have her diet, whether to be a vegetarian or not, and have her with the training routine, whether it's running 3 km in the morning, or she do some other type of cardio, or do some exercise with some of her muscle groups. She can find them all at the gym. So, just being a vegetarian and having something on her own might not be the best way to get a healthier life.","Okay, so, I think for my neighbor who's like 45 years old, if she's, you know, getting a bit overweight and wants to live healthier, I’d totally suggest she check out a gym. The thing is, when she goes to the gym, she can actually work out pretty effectively. Most gyms have personal trainers or fitness coaches around to help everyone out during their workouts. They can also support her with her diet and create a training routine, like telling her what to do and how to do it.

Plus, I mean, just being a vegetarian doesn’t automatically mean you’re eating healthy. People really need a variety of nutrients to stay healthy, you know? And running 3 km every morning is just, like, an idea I’m throwing out there right now. She might be able to do it, or maybe not, and even if she can’t stick to it regularly, it doesn’t guarantee she’s gonna get healthier.

So, for me, going to the gym would really help her with those other options too. She can work with a personal trainer, figure out her diet—whether she wants to be vegetarian or not—and get some guidance on her training routine. Whether it’s running 3 km in the morning, or doing some other kind of cardio, or working on different muscle groups, she can find all that at the gym.

First the open air market, I think they don't have enough high quality product over there And also in Vietnam the open air market had kind of a best kind of smell You know all the fish smell and everything Also I think that it is very crowded, especially during the covid I don't really like the crowded and also probably mainly because they don't have enough high quality product and what not The second one is a department store, I feel like the main thing I don't choose this is because they don't have the variety of product Yeah I think that is mainly because they don't have enough product for me to try For Ted Holiday we have to buy a lot of things Fresh stuff like fish, meat, also like decorating stuff, candy, so I probably go to the supermarket Supermarketly I think is super convenient, they have a wide range of products right? The price is cheap too, also the quality I feel like is more high quality than the open air market Also I think they have a lot of service for you, they can help you ship good to your house If you buy a lot of stuff and it might be too hard to carry home Also I think like the supermarket during the Ted Holiday they used to have some band going on Like maybe sale off or something, buy one get one free, that kind of stuff So yeah I probably go to the supermarket I mean I could probably check out the department store for seeing if there is some good there But probably the best for the supermarket, I think most people go there too Just because like high quality product, the quality is assured Also wide range of products, cheap, it's convenient, it's big and it smells good, unlike the open air market","Okay, so I went to the supermarket, right? First, I checked out the open air market, but honestly, I just don’t think they have enough high-quality products there. And in Vietnam, the open air market has, like, this strong smell, you know? It’s all the fish and everything, and it's really crowded—especially during COVID! I really don’t like crowded places, and like I said, they just don’t have enough good quality stuff.

Then I looked at the department store, but the thing is, they don’t have a lot of variety. I feel like they don’t carry enough products for me to choose from. For Tet Holiday, we have to buy lots of stuff, right? Fresh things like fish and meat, plus decoration stuff and candy, so I probably just go to the supermarket.

Supermarkets are super convenient—they've got a wide range of products, you know? The prices are cheap, and the quality seems much better than what you'd find at the open air market. Plus, they have services to help, like shipping your groceries to your house if you buy a lot. That’s really helpful, especially if you have too much to carry home.

Oh, and during Tet, supermarkets usually have cool promotions, like sales or buy one get one free, that kind of thing. So yeah, I’ll probably go with the supermarket. I mean, I might check out the department store just to see if they have anything good, but overall, I think the supermarket is the best choice. Most people go there too because the products are high quality, and it's affordable, convenient, and way more spacious. And it just smells better, unlike the open air market!",9.0,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD10_2/audio/HUST30523GBJG166/HUST3005230105-2.mp3,CD10_2,2
audio/HUST281123C16D166/HUST2811230119-2.ogg," So in August, if you want to have a visit to Vietnam, there are many options that you can think of. We have Hanoi, we have Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Hue. The best part is every location in Vietnam is beautiful. It is just the fact that you know where to go, at which time, with whom. So what I think about that, because you are going to Vietnam only for three days, which are relatively short, and it is in August, which are quite hot in Vietnam. So I think that you can go to Hanoi. Hanoi is a very interesting place, and the advantage of this is I am staying here with my families, so I can take care of you. Like going around and showing you around Hanoi, and even go to some kind of a nearby cities and provinces. For example, like Quang Linh or Ha Lam. Hanoi only takes like two hours from Hanoi to Quang Linh, or even Ha Phong. You can enjoy the lovely beach over there, enjoy the seafood, fresh ones. And then you can return to Hanoi in one day, or if you like, you can stay a night at Quang Linh. Quang Linh is in Ha Lam Bay, and you can enjoy a good night or a good time at the bay. So back to Hanoi. Hanoi has a lot of activities, and I don't think that you can explore it fully in three days. You can enjoy seafood, you can enjoy some kind of a traditionals and culture of Vietnam, which are basically in Hanoi, especially in terms of politics. You can visit Ho Chi Minh, I can give you a ride at 9pm to see kind of a ceremony of laying on the flat. What should I call this one? Like it is a waving flat ceremony at 9pm. And also you can enjoy many other activities such as going for a bar or pub, or enjoying lovely coffee. I can show you Huan Kim Lek, which is a very beautiful one. And there is a cafe over there, which I call, which is name is Luuk Thuy. So this is translated as green water, because it faces directly towards Huan Kim Lek. And you want, I think it is the best coffee that you can visit in Hanoi. But you don't have to be there in the morning. So anyway, that is my suggestion. I think that you can go to Hanoi and we can figure out your agenda.","Okay, so if you're thinking about visiting Vietnam in August, there are a bunch of great places you could check out, like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hue. Honestly, every spot in Vietnam has its charm, but it really depends on where you want to go, when you go, and who you go with. 

Since you’re only gonna be in Vietnam for three days, which is pretty short, and it’s gonna be hot in August, I think Hanoi is a great choice. I mean, it's really interesting here and the best part is I live here with my family, so I can totally show you around. We could even take a trip to nearby cities or provinces, like Quang Linh or Ha Lam. It’s just about a two-hour drive from Hanoi to Quang Linh or even Hai Phong. You can relax at the beach there and enjoy some fresh seafood, which is really nice. You could either come back to Hanoi the same day or stay overnight in Quang Linh if you want to soak up more of that vibe. 

So, back to Hanoi, there's so much to do that I doubt you'd be able to see everything in just three days. You can try all kinds of seafood and dive into the traditional culture, which is really vibrant here, especially in political spots. You could visit Ho Chi Minh’s Mausoleum, and I can take you for a ride around 9 PM to watch this flag-lowering ceremony. It’s pretty cool; they wave the flag at night. 

And there are tons of other fun things to do too, like hitting up a bar or pub, or just chilling with some good coffee. There's this one place called Hoan Kiem Lake, and there's a cafe nearby that I really love. It’s called Luuk Thuy, which means ""green water,"" and it has a great view of the lake. I think it’s the best coffee you can get in Hanoi, but you don’t have to go there in the morning—it’s good any time!

In a party, we can celebrate a really meaningful reunion, because we can organize a lot of events, like to play a lot of games, to recollect when we started in that school. And in that party, we can have so much time to spend on each other, to celebrate it. And for the two other options, for visiting all schools and teachers, I think it's not necessary, because before organizing a party, we can visit our old school and teachers whenever we have time. And for the option of holding a one-day trip, I think it's too short. And it's not meaningful to organize a party and invite teachers and classmates in that party. And another reason that I choose to organize a party and invite teachers and classmates in that party is that because I am a leader of the class when I was in high school, I can manage to buy and to prepare everything that I can to organize a really meaningful and big party.","Okay, so if my friend wants to organize a 10-year high school reunion, I’d definitely go with throwing a party and inviting all the teachers and classmates to join in.

It’d give us a lot of time to catch up and celebrate together, you know?

Now, for the other two options, like visiting the school and teachers, I think that’s kinda unnecessary. I mean, we could always drop by our old school and see our teachers whenever we have some free time, so why not make it more fun with a party? And as for the one-day trip option, to me, that seems too short. It wouldn’t really be meaningful to just do a quick trip instead of having a nice party with everyone there.

Another reason I think organizing a party is the way to go is 'cause I was the class leader back in high school, so I can totally manage everything. I can take care of all the buying and planning to make it a big and memorable celebration.

So, personally, my mom is a baker and I really do enjoy baking cake. The disadvantages of making cake compared to buying it is that when you make a cake, the process of making a cake depends on how the ingredients are prepared and how much ingredients you're willing to spend on. So, when you make a cake, there are special cakes and there are normal cakes. So, making cakes is costly, time-consuming, but the process of making it is really enjoyable. However, when you buy a cake, you can just go to the store, prepare for your money, and just buy it, give it to the cashier, and take the cake home. So, both have advantages and disadvantages. However, for me, I enjoy making cakes. And I also love making cakes with my mom since she is a baker and she can really thoroughly guide me in making a cake. Since my mom used to have her own shop, a bakery, all the ingredients and all the tools needed for making cake is already there. And so, I would choose my mom when I make a cake. I would choose my mom and be with her since it is also her passion. It's not mine yet, but the process of making it is very enjoyable for me. It's also a very good time for me and my mom to spend time together since I'm already old enough and I also have a group of people who are with me all the time. So, making cake with my mom is something special since probably it's the only time we can somehow spend time together. And also, when I make cake, it reminds me of my childhood because it brings back memories of how my mom took care of us and how she juggles to make cakes, the orders of cakes, and how she takes care of us, me, my brother, and my sister. So, it brings back memories, good memories of our old home and it's mostly the memories of my mom because this is her passion, this is her talent, and this is her life, I would say.

On the other hand, if you decide to buy a cake, it’s simple: you just go to the store, bring some cash, hand it to the cashier, and take your cake home.

audio/HUST24223GHH9166/HUST2402230047-3.ogg," It has been common knowledge that online learning is beneficial to students for several reasons as following. Firstly, it is considered to be very convenient for students who are far away from the schools to be able to still attend the classroom in time without spending too much time commuting. The students can study everywhere, anywhere they want. They can study on the bed, they can study as soon as they wake up or even when they are traveling and it is very convenient. Another point is that online learning has made studying very affordable for people. For example, when you want to study, you found a very suitable course for you but it is in Finland and the cost of living there is very high. And if you do go to Finland to attend the course, you might have to spend a lot of time, a lot of your free time, besides studying, to work part-time job to earn more living to cover your cost of living and that can be very tiring. So online learning can be a solution to that. That is, you can still attend a course that you think is suitable for you abroad but you attend them online so that you can still receive the high quality international education system while still being able to afford your life. And another point, the third point is that with online learning you can be very flexible with your time. You can, as mentioned earlier, it saves time on commuting and you can just schedule your online learning as suitable to your schedule. So for example, if you are working and you have to go on business trips for a while, then you can still attend the classes as you wish. And another point that I think, the last point on our list is that online learning can be for everyone from all backgrounds. So as long as you have access to internet, it is not a problem for you to attend the course and gain knowledge and it is also cheaper than actually going to classrooms because it saves money on all these equipment in the classrooms and all the human resource management. While discussing the benefits of online learning, we also have to discuss some of the disadvantages that online learning have compared to learning in traditional classroom settings. One major disadvantage that I think of is that online learning lacks the interaction that the traditional classroom setting have and that is the person to person interaction. I think that is something...","Okay, so, I've been thinking about online learning, right? And it's pretty common knowledge that it has a lot of benefits for students for a few reasons. First off, it’s super convenient, especially for students who live far from their schools. Like, they can still attend class without wasting too much time commuting. I mean, they can study anywhere, you know? They could be in bed, they could jump on a lesson right after they wake up, or even while they’re traveling. It’s just really easy for them. 

Then there’s the fact that online learning can be way more affordable. Like, let’s say you find this really great course, but it’s in Finland, and the cost of living there is crazy high. So if you decide to go there for the course, you might end up having to work a part-time job just to cover your living expenses, which can be super tiring. But with online courses, you can join that same class from anywhere and still get that high-quality international education without breaking the bank.

Another thing is flexibility. You know how I mentioned saving time on commuting? Well, online learning lets you really arrange your study time around your life. So, for example, if you have a job and need to go on business trips, there’s no stress because you can still join your classes whenever it fits your schedule.

And, you know, one last thing I think is important is that online learning is accessible to pretty much everyone, no matter where you're coming from. As long as you’ve got internet access, you can take part in courses and learn. Plus, it usually costs less than going to a physical classroom because it cuts down on all the extra expenses like equipment and managing resources.

But, you know, while we’re talking about all the benefits, we should also think about some downsides of online learning compared to the traditional classroom setup. One major downside I can think of is the lack of interaction. You don’t get that same personal connection you get in a traditional classroom. It’s like, person-to-person interaction is something...",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_1/audio/HUST24223GHH9166/HUST2402230047-3.mp3,CD7_1,3

I also like to say that I use body language often in communication like in class, when I'm teaching or at sports, when I'm doing exercises like football because it really enhances me and it gives me a broader way of talking and letting people see exactly what I'm doing. In most situations that I use body language will be practical, it's like when I'm teaching. When I'm teaching my students, I like to be very funny and I like to be a clown because it helps display me to them and they can see exactly what body language I'm doing. For example, if I'm angry, I have an angry sign which I show. If I'm sad, I have a sad sign which I'm showing. If I am happy, I have a sign which I show. So I would say that body language are very beneficial in teaching, especially for teachers because it really gives teachers that practicality and it really enables students to be able to learn from all that and to be able to put that into a more practical daily life. So body language overall is like the best possible means of communication because it actually it gives you a more broader way to be able to talk to your students and to be able to make them understand about the different signs of body languages. So I would say that body language enhances communication and productivity in teaching. In conclusion, I would advise teachers to always use body language often when they are in class because it enables their students to be able to see and to be able to practically do those things that will enable them to in in breathing embody their mental aspects in in listening and also in speaking. So in conclusion, body language is very effective while you are a teacher and teaching in the classroom. Thank you.","Okay, so first off, I wanna say that body language in communication is like, a super effective tool. I mean, I use body language all the time, whether I’m teaching in class or playing sports like football. It really helps me connect and communicate better, you know? It gives me a way to show people exactly what I'm trying to say. 

Most of the time, when I use body language, it's really practical. For instance, when I’m teaching my students, I like to be funny and kinda like a clown, 'cause it helps them see what I'm doing with my body. Like, if I'm angry, I have this angry sign I show. If I’m sad, there's a sad sign too. And if I'm happy, well, I show that as well! So, I’d definitely say that body language is super beneficial in teaching, especially for us teachers. It really helps students learn and understand better.

Overall, I think body language is like the best way to communicate. It opens up a wider way for me to connect with my students and make them grasp the different signs that go with body language. So, yeah, body language totally enhances communication and productivity in teaching. 

In conclusion, I’d really recommend that teachers use body language a lot when they’re in class. It helps students see and practically do things that can really aid them in grasping both the mental aspects of listening and speaking. So yeah, body language is super effective when you're a teacher in the classroom.

Nowadays we deploy a lot of internet connected things like IoT and Internet of Things so every TC25 in your family can be connected to the Internet automatically so if someone has a bot that has a purpose with you, they can hack or use some trick to steal your information, steal your image, steal your personal image, or steal your banking account information and they can benefit from them. So for that reason, most of our home is now connected to the Internet with a lot of complicated TC25 devices so that is the reason why I agree that our home is no longer a safe place to live right now until you disconnect everything from your home from the Internet. To stay away from online trends, to stay away from online trends, I do not deny that we can live without things like laptops or mobile phones so we always stay connected to the Internet every day, every time we awake so to stay away from the threats I mentioned above, you can do some safe-guiding from the experts to protect your device, your information from the attack like you can install antivirus software from the rabbit-to-mo company, you can shut down the connect whenever you no longer use it or you can use a strong password and reset your password every one to six months to keep it secure and for the health cannot predict your password and many other solutions you can apply but those are the three solutions I think the principle solution you can use to stay away from the online threats. For the governance side, to help people protect their privacy from online threats, first of all, I think the governance should have at least the strict law related to privacy violations by conspiracy or online attacking from the Internet so when you have the strict law you have to enhance or to protect the online privacy of people.","Okay, so I totally agree that our homes aren't really safe places to live anymore, you know? It’s like we’re facing all these issues from the Internet like computer viruses, personal info hacking, spam, and so on. Nowadays, we’ve got so many internet-connected things, like IoT devices, so every gadget in your house can be linked to the Internet. And if someone with bad intentions gets access to that, they can hack in and steal your info, your pictures, or even your banking details. It's kinda scary, right? 

So, yeah, that's why I believe our homes are no longer safe unless you disconnect everything from the Internet, like seriously. I mean, it’s tough to stay away from online stuff since we can't really live without our laptops or phones—they're basically glued to us every waking moment. To protect ourselves from these threats I mentioned, we can take some precautionary measures from the experts to keep our devices and information safe. 

For example, you might wanna install antivirus software from a good company, shut down your connections when you're not using them, and set strong passwords, resetting them every one to six months is a good idea too. Those are just a few easy steps, but I think they’re the main ones you should definitely think about.

As for the government, I think they need to step up to help people protect their privacy against online threats. Like, they should have some strict laws about privacy violations and online attacks. If there are solid laws in place, that can really help to enhance people's online privacy, you know what I mean?",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C167/HUST1411220062-3.mp3,CD3,3

Before, I have to choose among 3 options, talking to your friends, reading a book or doing a site. Let's talk about all of them. First and foremost, I believe that talking to the friends is my best choice. First and foremost, it makes me really stressed after an academic lesson. I have many stress and stress. So, talking with my friends, I think it's fun. And yes, a national reason, I think I can share about a story in my life and maybe discuss a lesson. If I have a difficult touch with English, I will talk with friends and they will help me and practice with me. I will have a high mark or good academic performance. I will be reliable and ignore 2 options, reading books or doing a website. Reading books is boring. I cannot concentrate on the content of the book. It makes me distracted. During exercise, I'm not good at sports and I'm lazy. I think it's not suitable for me. Talking to the friends has many benefits for me. I have a good mood. For all reasons, I put a post. I think talking to my friends is good.","So, okay, I'm gonna talk about what I'd do if I had like, 30 minutes after an English lesson. And, um, I guess I have to choose between three options: talking to my friends, reading a book, or doing some exercise. So, let’s go over those. 

First off, I really think talking to my friends is the best choice. You know, after an academic lesson, I'm usually really stressed out. I mean, I’ve got a lot on my plate. So, talking with my friends is just fun and it helps me unwind. Plus, I can share stories from my life and, like, we can discuss what we learned in class together. If I run into a tough topic in English, my friends can help me out and we can practice together. That way, I’ve got a better shot at getting a good mark and improving my academic performance, right?

Now, about the other two options, honestly, I don't think I'd pick reading books. I find it kinda boring, and I just can’t focus on the content, you know? I end up getting distracted way too easily. And when it comes to doing exercise, I'm not really good at it and, to be honest, I can be pretty lazy, so that’s definitely not my thing.

So, yeah, talking to my friends just has so many benefits for me. It lifts my mood and, for all those reasons, I really believe that talking to my friends is the way to go.",8.0,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC167/HUST3110230143-2.mp3,CD16_2,2

I felt, you know, super tired and I could not, you know, have enough energy to get out of my bed. I did not visit a doctor because at that time I was quarantined in my room and therefore you know the only thing that I could do was to, you know, call the doctor on the phone and ask for his advice. I was privileged enough to have my mother buying the medicine and cooking all the food for me. So, after following the doctor's advice and, you know, taking in all the medicine and the food that my mother brought me, I fully recovered after about two weeks. Coming to the second topic which is language learning. So I could speak two languages. The first one is Vietnamese which is my mother tongue and the second one is English. I have been learning English for, you know, more than 15 years and at the moment I'm quite confident with, you know, my English. Well, you know, I do believe that I'm relatively good at learning languages because firstly I am passionate about learning a new language. Not only can I communicate with people from other countries and therefore expand and therefore improve my business opportunities, but I could also have the chance to learn more about a foreign culture which could always excite me in one way or the other. Well, I think that, you know, in this Golden Age of Globalization when English has already become the global language, learning English is arguably the best way for people to integrate into the global village and therefore, you know, find more business opportunities or scholarships to study in a foreign nation.","So, there was this time, like a couple of months ago, when I got really sick with COVID-19.

So, like, the only thing I could do was call the doctor and get some advice over the phone. I was lucky 'cause my mom helped me out a lot; she bought my medicine and cooked all my meals. After following the doctor's advice and taking all the meds and eating the food my mom cooked, I finally recovered after about two weeks.

Okay, so moving on to the second topic, which is language learning. I can speak two languages: Vietnamese, which is my mother tongue, and English. I've been learning English for, like, more than 15 years now, and I feel pretty confident about it, you know? I think I'm kinda good at learning languages, mainly 'cause I'm really passionate about it. 

It’s not just about talking to people from different countries and, you know, opening up more biz opportunities, but I also get to dive into foreign cultures, which is always exciting for me.

At the moment I live in an apartment and it's a tiny apartment and I hardly have any windows and the apartment is small and there's hardly any space for me to to walk around I guess. Living in a house for me it's more advantageous because there's plenty of room and in my ideal home I like to have a garden or even a patio. A patio where I could have a table to have a coffee table and chairs to have a coffee or to even to have a meal. A house provides more space and outdoor space as well. A flat can have a balcony I suppose however it can be small and you have the view of your neighbor's home or your neighbor can or the building across from you can look at your balcony look at you see you in the apartment even so I don't like living in an apartment I wouldn't like living in an apartment because there's no privacy other people can look into your apartment and that really bothers me however when you live in a house you have unless you're surrounded by tall flats tall buildings you have privacy lots of privacy however there's one good advantage about living in a flat though because there's more security there's a security at the at the entrance to the flat and there's more security whereas in a house you have to have your own security you have to have your own alarm Right my dream house my dream house would be on two floors it would have the living room and the kitchen on the ground floor and I would have some French windows opening up into a nice terrace where I would have a table and and chairs for me to have coffee or dinner or have to have meals there and then that would lead to a small little garden where I could have some plants or even a little swing I've always wanted to have a little bench that swings and that is a swing it's for the children to play or even to have a little yeah garden I would love that I would also like a pool next to the garden my own private pool not a very big,"Okay, so I really would love to live in a house, and let me tell you why. Right now, I’m living in this tiny apartment, and honestly, it’s super cramped. I hardly have any windows, and there’s barely any space for me to walk around, you know? So, for me, living in a house would be so much better 'cause there’s way more room. I’d love to have a garden or even a patio, like a nice spot where I could put a table and some chairs to have my coffee or even meals outside. 

In a house, you get that extra space, plus a nice outdoor area. Sure, apartments can have a balcony, but usually, they’re small, and then you’re stuck looking at your neighbor's place or they can see right into your balcony, which is kinda awkward, right? I really don’t like living in an apartment for that reason—there's just no privacy. Other people can, like, look into your apartment, and that really bothers me. But in a house, unless you’re surrounded by tall buildings, you’ve got a lot more privacy.

Now, I gotta admit, there’s one good thing about living in a flat, and that's security. You’ve got security at the entrance, which you don’t get in a house unless you set it up yourself and have your own alarm. 

So, my dream house? It would definitely be two floors. I’d want the living room and kitchen on the ground floor, and I’d have these nice French windows that open out to a lovely terrace. I imagine having a table and chairs out there for coffee or dinner, and it would lead to a small little garden. I’d love to have some plants, and maybe even a swing. I’ve always wanted a little bench that swings, you know? It could be fun for kids to play on or just a nice spot to hang out. And, oh—I'd definitely want a pool next to the garden, my own private pool, not super big or anything, but just enough to enjoy.",9.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230228-1.mp3,CD16_3,1

So the first reason is, so the first advantage is travelling by plane is fast. So yes, undoubtedly, train, train, plane have the most, have the highest speed for travelling. It can lift, it can lift up, its speed can up to 1000 km per hour. And now the second thing is travelling by plane suitable for long distance. Of course, if we travel from Vietnam to another country, we still can travel by the other transportation. However, travelling by plane is not fastest and therefore is suitable for the long distance. So we don't need to wait for the traffic jam or wait for the traffic light to or anything that can be inconvenient for our travelling. So the next thing is when we travel by the plane, so we like will not because the atmosphere, because the atmosphere at this plane is quite clear, so we don't have to face with the air pollution or maybe the noise pollution when we travel on the road. So and the next thing is when we travelling by plane, so we just the passenger which we need to sit or need to sit and like we need and we can like give all our, give all of our choice to the pilot and the flight attendant. And oh, and yes, because of in the plane there's a lot of flight attendant, they are very like care for you. So I believe that in the plane like there is no like trip or maybe someone stolen your things in the plane. And for me and for me for my perspective, I also I believe that travelling by plane is the most useful want and people if they have a chain and if they don't have like if they like don't have the money and have the budget to go by plane, so they should consider trans plane as their transportation, mean of transportation. That's all. Thank you for your listening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","Okay, so it's pretty clear that out of all the types of transportation like trains, cars, or motorbikes, I think traveling by plane has the most advantages and is the most effective way to get around. So, the first reason is that flying is super fast. I mean, planes can reach speeds of up to like 1,000 kilometers per hour, which is way faster than trains or cars.

Now, the second point is that flying is really suitable for long distances. Sure, we can drive or take a train from Vietnam to another country, but those aren’t the fastest options. When you fly, you don’t have to deal with traffic jams or waiting at traffic lights, which makes it way more convenient for long trips.

And another thing is, when we travel by plane, the atmosphere is a lot nicer. You know, we don’t have to deal with air pollution or noise pollution like we do when we’re on the road. It’s just a more pleasant experience overall.

Plus, when you’re on a plane, you just have to sit back and relax. You can let the pilot and flight attendants take care of everything for you. And honestly, the flight attendants are really attentive and look out for you, so you generally don’t have to worry about things like theft while you’re flying.

So, from my perspective, I really believe that traveling by plane is the best option. If people have the chance to fly but are worried about the costs, I think they should really consider it as a great way to travel. That's all I wanted to say.

audio/HUST241022SCRI166/HUST2410220021-3.ogg," University time is really a walk to remember in everybody's life. In university level, or in the university state of life, people have a chance to acquire very valuable knowledge, which they will later apply in their job in the future. Moreover, there are a lot of students coming from other areas because they are in a place where their university is located. So they have to learn how to live an independent life. This will improve their independence. Another point is that in university you have a very good chance to do the social networking because you have the opportunity to meet new people, to join new clubs and new activities, and you have to work in teams. All of them in total can make you have more friends, lead you to more network. When you know more people, you have better networking and you may have more chance to work. However, the most memorable thing about university time is that you have a chance to work part time. These early experiences will do their job very well when you are applying for a company and applying for a full-time job. A lot of employers now will not consider any candidates if they don't have any working experience during the university time. So working during the university time, working during the tertiary education time, is a thing that is not only necessary but should be required in the curriculum of the university. In my opinion, Vietnamese universities are doing a very great job in educating people, giving them knowledge and preparing them for the job market in the future. However, if there is one thing that should be improved, there is still room for improvement. If there is one thing to improve, it must be the teaching of soft skills. Many students of those universities in Vietnam are coming from the countryside or coming from the very poor areas of the country. So what they lack the most is the soft skills or the skills in dealing with social contacts. Those soft skills are normally not taught or lectured in universities. So there should be programmes on presentation and dealing with jobs and dealing with discussion on salary negotiation, how to handle your anger, how to handle miscommunication. All these soft skills are critical and essential to prepare for students to become a good worker, a good employee and to become a good resident of the society. That is all I think about university life in Vietnam and also in many other countries in general. Thank you.","Okay, so university life is really something that everyone remembers, right? When you’re at the university level, or just in that phase of life, you get this awesome chance to learn really valuable stuff that you’ll use in your job later on. Plus, a lot of students come from different places to attend schools where they’re located, so they gotta learn how to live independently. And I mean, that definitely helps them to become more independent.

Another thing is, university gives you a great opportunity to do some social networking. You get to meet new people, join clubs, participate in activities, and work in teams. All of this combined means you can make more friends and expand your network. And the more people you know, the better your networking becomes, which can open up more job opportunities for you.

But honestly, one of the most memorable parts of university is getting to work part-time. Those early work experiences can really boost your chances when you're applying for a full-time job later. A lot of employers nowadays won’t even look at candidates who don’t have any work experience during their university years. So, working while you’re in school isn’t just helpful; I think it should totally be a part of the curriculum.

Now, I believe Vietnamese universities are doing a really great job overall, educating students and prepping them for the job market in the future. But if there’s one area that could use some improvement, it’s definitely teaching soft skills. Many students come from rural or less privileged areas, so they usually don’t have a lot of those social skills down. Like, things you don’t usually learn in class, right? 

So, I think there should be programs focused on presentation skills, handling job interviews, discussing salary negotiations, managing anger, and figuring out how to deal with miscommunication. All these soft skills are super important to help students become good employees and good members of society.

Well, I'm an introvert myself, and I'm really easy to get annoyed by noises. And I do find noises sometimes become annoying because it can affect my concentration in a subject which is not good at all. For the second question, the type of noise that I come across in my daily life, well, the first noise that comes to my head is the construction noises. I'm living near a construction site which is very noisy every day. The sound of drilling, excavating and more just keep coming across every day of my life. For the third question is too much noise in modern city. I do agree that modern city has too much noise because the increasing of transporting vehicles, in more particular is the private transport has been increasing this year, especially cars. So I think that noise in modern city is too much. Modern city also have some other noises such as, in my case, is the construction site. Okay.","Okay, so I’ll go ahead and choose the second topic.

And then for the third question about whether there’s too much noise in modern cities, I totally agree. I think modern cities have way too much noise, mainly because of the increase in vehicles. Especially, like, private transport has really shot up this year, particularly cars. So yeah, the noise in modern cities is just, it’s overwhelming.

audio/HUST6723KTLX167/HUST0607230140-3.ogg," Activities that happen after studying at school benefit students a lot based on some reason. Firstly, these kinds of activities can improve the student's communication skills. For example, when you join an activity like that, you have to interact with other students. You have to ask or answer their questions about specific topics or subjects. You have to find a way to let the information out or get the information in your mind. I think it benefits the students a lot in the communication field. Moreover, it can improve the networking ability. I mean, the spirit of team building, I think so. They know how to be a good member in a team and be a good co-worker and how to build up a team to complete a task. All of that skills can make their life better in the future. It could contribute a lot to their futures when they work in a company or a corporation, especially in the modern life. Finally, they can learn how to manage time through joining activities after studying at school. When they participate in this kind of activity, they learn from the other students how to divide the schedule, the timeline into different categories to deal with different kinds of tasks. For example, with a simple task, you should spend less amount of time for that. But for a hard task, you have to spend much larger amount of time to deal with that mission. I think after school activities benefit students a lot through the communication, through building up communication, networking, and time management. And talking about common extracurricular activities for students, they can join in activities like badminton, playing badminton, or a meeting or something like that. I don't think curriculum activities should be made compulsory for students because","Okay, so you know, activities that happen after school, I think they really benefit students a lot for a few reasons. First off, these activities can really improve students' communication skills. Like, when you join an activity, you have to interact with other students, right? You gotta ask and answer questions about different topics. It really helps you figure out how to share information or, like, understand what's being communicated. So I think it's super beneficial for students in terms of communication.

Plus, it can also boost their networking skills. I mean, when it comes to team building, they learn how to work well with others. They get to know how to be a supportive team member and a good co-worker, and how to come together to get a task done. All those skills can seriously improve their future, especially when they’re working in a company or something in today's world.

And let’s not forget about time management. When students get involved in activities after school, they learn from each other how to plan their schedules, you know, how to break down timelines into different parts for different tasks. Like, for a simple task, you don’t want to spend too much time on it, but for a tougher task, you definitely gotta dedicate more time to it. 

So, yeah, I really think these after-school activities help students a ton, especially with communication, networking, and managing their time better. And if we’re talking about common extracurricular activities, they can do stuff like playing badminton or joining a club or meetings and things like that.

The first reason is that with technology we can improve the knowledge. There are some online websites, courses or tools in the web like ZPT. We can look for some information that we cannot find in our lecture or teacher. The first reason is that technology will provide some learning resources. Like I said, that's the first reason. With technology we can use the mobile phone, use the computer to access some online websites, some online courses to get some learning resources that we don't have when we learn in the school. The third reason is that technology will reduce the code of study because of some reason. Firstly, we can use the iPad, use the mobile phone or computer to access some learning resources like PDF or e-book instead of taking a course to buy it. So, using this technology item will reduce the course of study. With this feature, using technology will also reduce the course of study. For some reason, it's that students don't have to use some education supplies like the paper or the black card to give some information that they want to convey. Instead, they can use the screen or the mobile phone or use the iPad. The technology has some negative effects. For example, we can use the technology to extract videos or social media like Instagram or Facebook that will impact you when we are learning in school.","Okay, so my topic is how technology supports student learning, right? And I really think that technology plays a big role in helping students learn. Like, the first reason is that technology helps us improve our knowledge, you know? There are all these online websites, courses, and tools available online, like this thing called ZPT. We can find info that we might not get from our lectures or teachers. 

So, the first reason, again, is that technology gives us access to learning resources. As I mentioned, we can use our mobile phones or computers to check out online websites and courses to get resources that aren't available when we're just learning in school. 

Then, there's the third reason, which is that technology can lower the cost of studying, and here’s why: we can use iPads, mobile phones, or computers to access learning materials like PDFs or e-books instead of having to buy physical books or take courses. So, using these tech tools definitely helps cut down the costs of studying.

And, you know, another point is that students don’t really need to rely on traditional educational supplies, like paper or notebooks. Instead, they can just use their screens or gadgets like tablets and phones for the information they want to share. 

But, of course, there are some negative effects, too. Like, sometimes we might get distracted by social media or videos on platforms like Instagram or Facebook, which can really impact how we learn in school. So, it's kinda a mixed bag, for sure!",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD14_2/audio/HUST111223FIAI166/HUST1112230111-3.mp3,CD14_2,3

At the same time, you are aware of the different ingredients that you used in cooking. So you know whether you're using healthy ingredients and you know that it's being cooked in a clean way because you're the one cooking it at home. At the same time, it also saves a lot of money because if you will eat in a restaurant, it would be a lot expensive because you're paying for the place, for the service and the food. But if you're just like cooking at home, you can save a lot of money. At the same time, you'll enjoy the food because this is the food that you want to eat. At the same time, it's also a good way to bond with your family. So, you know, if you are a mom, you could just like teach your daughter how to cook or you can just like spend some time with your husband in the kitchen just to cook for the food of your choice. And also, yes, what I have said, it increased food safety because you are the one preparing it and you are 100% sure that it's being prepared and cooked in a clean way. I myself believe that if I just have so much time to do cooking at home, I would love to cook at home. I am very into homemade food and yes, spending some time outside would also give me a refreshing environment. But for myself, I am a homey person, so I would prefer staying at home and cook for myself and for my family. For the follow-up questions, cooking is both a pleasure and a chore for people. Pleasure for those people who finds cooking as their passion or for those people who wants to be a chef, I think that is like a pleasure to them because you've been like doing what you love the most. Sure for married people, I guess, especially for moms because you have to provide a very good nutrition to your children and you have to make sure that you are feeding your children well. So for me, it's a chore for married couples. And disadvantages of cooking your meals at home, you need a lot of time. And yeah, instead of like resting when you arrive home, you have to spend some time for cooking. Habit of cooking at home changed in the past 10 years is that maybe before we used to cook using coals or fire foods, but lately it's been like the way of cooking has evolved. So mostly people cook using stove or electric stoves. And preservatives were added to food as well.","Okay, so cooking at home really gives you, like, the chance to make whatever food you want. You know exactly what's going into your dishes 'cause you’re the one picking the ingredients. So, I mean, you know if you’re using healthy stuff and, like, you can be sure it's all clean since you’re cooking it yourself. Plus, it saves a ton of money! Eating out can get super pricey, you know? You have to pay for the place, the service, all that, and if you're just cooking at home, you're just paying for the ingredients. 

And you'll enjoy it more since it's the food you really want to eat. Also, cooking at home is a great way to bond with your family. Like, if you’re a mom, you could teach your daughter how to cook or, I don’t know, spend some time with your husband in the kitchen prepping a meal together. It’s also about food safety since you’re the one making it, you know it's all being done in a clean way. I truly believe that if I had more time, I’d definitely cook at home more. I just love homemade food! Sure, going out can be refreshing and all, but honestly, I’m more of a homebody, so staying in and cooking for my family is where it’s at for me. 

As for the follow-up questions, cooking can be both enjoyable and a bit of work for people. For folks who love cooking or wanna be chefs, it’s definitely a pleasure, right? But for married people, especially moms, it can feel like a chore ‘cause you gotta make sure your family is getting good nutrition. So for some, it's more of an obligation. 

Now, when it comes to the disadvantages of cooking at home, yeah, it takes a lot of time. Like, instead of just chilling when you get home, you gotta spend that time prepping and cooking. And about how cooking habits have changed over the past ten years, I mean, we used to cook with coals or fire, but now, it’s mostly electric stoves, which is a big change. Plus, there are a lot more preservatives going into food these days too.",9.0,8.5,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C167/HUST1411220053-3.mp3,CD3,3

Actually, we have many kind of park in my area and that allows people to go in jogging or running or just relaxing on the flower bed. Actually, in my opinion, the thing that makes a good park is providing many trees. It can allow people to have an atmosphere. I mean, it's fresh atmosphere. However, about the good park, they also adapt to the requirements of many generations of the individuals who want to go into the park. So, I think it's a good park for all generations, for the activities in outdoor like yoga and for the young generations, in some activities like hip hop or dancing in a park. Yeah, and totally in conclusion, I mean, the way to make a good park is adapt for the requirements of individuals as well as have many trees for providing freshness and flower pests for which people can see, watching and realizing themselves.

Yeah, people really tend to go to the park in my area to unwind and relax after a long work week. Actually, we have a lot of different kinds of parks around here, which is great because it lets people jog, run, or just chill out on the flower beds. In my opinion, a good park should have plenty of trees, you know? It creates a nice, fresh atmosphere. 

But, I think a good park also needs to meet the needs of all the different generations. So, it should be a place where everyone can hang out, whether it’s for outdoor activities like yoga or just younger folks wanting to do things like hip hop or dance. 

So, yeah, in conclusion, I mean, to make a good park, it's all about adapting to what people want, while also having lots of trees and flower beds to keep things fresh and pretty.

These people lied to me many, many times and from three options I would go for having a talk with her. Firstly, I know about her situation. I know about her character and I know why she lied to people and basically I understand the root reason why she is like that. And after understanding about that I will have a solution, many solutions actually for her and I will discuss with her about the disadvantages and the drawback of lying to people and the consequence after that. I can send her a story about why we should not tell her many stories about the bad consequence of lying to people. In Vietnamese we have many stories about that and also I will let her to talk about the drawback of lying to people and to make her understand deeply about the situation and then ask her about why we should not lie to people and then I will apply some solution for her. Let her understand and then give her a solution from easy to difficult solution and have a more detailed plan for why we should not lie to people. When she wants to lie to people what should she do after that and also apply punishment for her. If she lied to people, if I knew about that she would get consequence. She would get the punishment immediately after if I knew she would get that and she will understand that if she lied to people she would get some punishment from me. I think that is the best option for me to talk to her.","Okay, so in my life, a lot of people have lied to me, and one of those people is my younger sister. I mean, she's lied to me many, many times, and from the three options we have, I’d definitely choose to have a talk with her. 

First of all, I really know her situation and her character, and I get why she lies to people. So, knowing that gives me some insight into the root of the problem. After I understand all of that, I can think of a bunch of solutions to help her out, you know? 

I’d want to discuss with her the downsides of lying and what can happen as a consequence. I can actually share some stories about why we shouldn't lie – like, in Vietnamese culture, we have tons of stories that illustrate this. I'd encourage her to talk about the drawbacks too, so she really gets it.

Then, I would ask her why we shouldn’t lie. You know, just to make sure she thinks about it deeply. I’d lay out a plan for her, starting with easier solutions and then moving on to more difficult ones. I really want her to have a clear understanding of not just the why but also the what to do if she feels the urge to lie in the future.

And I think it's important to have some consequences, like if she lies and I find out, she’s gotta face some punishments. I mean, it’s crucial she knows that lying will have serious consequences from me. So, yeah, I think having that talk is the best way to approach the situation.",8.5,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_2/audio/HUST24223PUF8167/HUST2402230188-2.mp3,CD7_2,2
audio/HUST4423NA1U166/HUST0404230030-3.ogg," Regarding the topic of games in the classroom, in my opinion, I believe that games are very useful in the classroom. There are several reasons for my belief. First of all, it cannot be denied that games are always fun. So after a long hour of studying, some students can have some fun by playing some games. And if the game is creative enough, it can also transfer the knowledge and skills and some more information from the lesson to the student in the most energetic way. Therefore, the student can get the information in an easier way because the game is friendly. So the knowledge can go to the student in the fastest, easiest, and most energetic way. Secondly, through the game, we can improve the interaction between the teacher, the student, as well as between the students. After studying a long time, just teaching and listening to the teacher, the student may feel bored and with the game, like some interesting game, they can improve their energy by interacting with their teacher or their peer so that it can improve the team's morning in the classroom. Now I will answer the follow-up questions. For the disadvantage of using games in the classroom, I believe that there are several drawbacks of playing games in the classroom. At the age of 20, many boys, they will focus on the game and not the lesson, so they will be distracted from what they have learned before the game or after the game. They may be also still energetic and they cannot focus on what the teacher says after the game. So it could be a solution to play games at the end of the lesson. After the teacher says everything, every knowledge, every skill, they can use some games to boost off the emotion of the whole classroom, as well as transfer some more knowledge, some more skills of the lesson in the end of the class grade game. For the opinion of playing games, teaching people about life, I think that it depends on the type of game. If the game has practical knowledge or practical skills of daily life, I think they can teach the people about life, or else some games like video games or just nonsense games, they cannot deliver any message about life. So I think it depends mostly on the type of game and how people play in that game. With a suitable game, people are not only getting the life knowledge but also the skill. Thank you.","Okay, so talking about games in the classroom, I really think that they can be super useful. I mean, there are a few reasons why I believe that. First off, it’s clear that games are fun, right? After sitting through long hours of study, students really need a little break, and playing games can be a nice way to blow off some steam. And if the game is creative enough, it can also help students grasp knowledge and skills from the lesson in a really energetic way. You know, it makes learning a lot easier and, like, more friendly for them. 

Secondly, games can really boost interaction between teachers and students, as well as among the students themselves. I mean, after a long time of just listening to lectures, they might get bored. But with a fun game, they can really engage with their teacher and peers, which can really lift the mood in the classroom.

Now, onto the follow-up questions. As for the downsides of using games in class, I think there are a few drawbacks. For example, at age 20, some students might focus more on the game than the lesson, and that can be a distraction. They could be so pumped up from the game that they're not really paying attention to what the teacher is saying afterward. So, I think it might be better to play games at the end of the lesson. Like, after the teacher has covered everything, that way they can use games to boost everyone's energy and reinforce what they learned.

Regarding whether playing games can teach people about life, I think it really depends on the type of game. If a game offers practical knowledge or life skills, then it can definitely teach valuable lessons. But some games, like certain video games or just silly ones, might not really convey any meaningful messages about life. So yeah, it really comes down to the kind of game and how people play it. With the right game, people can not only learn about life but also pick up useful skills. Thank you!",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U166/HUST0404230030-3.mp3,CD8_1,3

I would not choose the option asking him to stop because as I said earlier that I believe in my younger brother when he is a high school student and he is mature enough to know and decide and to know what he should do and make his own decisions. Secondly I would let him continue but under my control means that I would also know the things between my brother and his girlfriend and I can make sure that okay so he can balance his study and the things that he wants and I can encourage him or I can help him solve the problems whenever it is raised. For the option informing parents I personally speaking I do not reckon this is a good idea because parents are often worried much about their child studies at school and for example Vietnamese parents often considered love at high school is something preventing their children from studying well or keeping up with their friends or with the lecturers at school so if I tell my parents about my younger brother's girlfriend then my parents would probably have negative actions towards this the relationship between my brother and the girls so personally I do not think that this is a good idea so overall I would choose to allow my younger brother to continue with his relationship but he must tell me things about that,"Okay, so if I were in this situation, I’d go with the second option, which is letting my younger brother keep seeing his girlfriend but, you know, under my control. The first reason is that I really believe when he’s in high school, he’s mature enough to know what he wants and what he’s doing. He can figure out how to manage and balance his love life with his studies at school. 

I wouldn't pick the option of making him stop, ’cause like I said earlier, I trust my younger brother. I mean, he’s in high school, and he can make his own decisions about what he should do. 

Secondly, letting him continue but under my control means I’d want to stay involved in what’s going on between him and his girlfriend. So, I could make sure he’s balancing his studies and his relationship, and, you know, I can encourage him or help him work through any problems that come up. 

As for telling our parents, I don't really think that's a good idea. Personally, I believe parents tend to worry too much about their kids' school stuff. Like, especially Vietnamese parents often see high school relationships as something that could distract their kids from studying well, or, you know, keeping up with their friends and teachers. So if I told my parents about my brother’s girlfriend, I’m pretty sure they’d react negatively toward the whole relationship.

So, overall, I’d choose to let my younger brother continue his relationship, but he’d definitely have to keep me in the loop about what’s going on.",9.0,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD1/audio/HUST26922WT9V167/HUST2609220076-2.mp3,CD1,2

Yeah first I totally agree with this statement doing exercise is very good for our health because of several benefits. First we all know that doing exercise helps us to prevent diseases like diabetes or obesity or high blood pressures. Yeah we all know that today these diseases they are very popular so one of the best way to prevent those diseases is to doing exercise. And besides doing exercise keep our feet here every body. I believe that every people want to have a fit body so doing exercise is a great way for us to maintain the fit body. It's not just about physical appearance but it's also about the mental health. Doing exercise helps us to have better mental health. Today in the busy life we face a lot of stress at work and stress with my friends, my family so doing exercise is one of the good ways to help us to overcome the hard situation in our busy life. And also I'm a person who loves doing exercise too. Yeah the type of exercise I like most is joking because it's simple and it's useful. I can go joking in very simple places like a yard or a lake or a park. You can use many places to exercise joking. People in my country do exercise just like me or a lake in the yard. Today many young people want to go to the gym to practice many other types of exercise in the gym. I think the gym is also a good choice because you don't have to face weather problems like the hot, rainy day or the dust in the air when you work or when you jog near a street. I believe that physical education should be compensatory at all school levels because it has many benefits. Just like I told before, it also helps children to work well with each other to understand the differences between each other. So we can work well. It's not just about how to build better physical health and mental health. Physical education leads children to work well with each other and to understand the differences of each other so they can be real friends. The answer is also a time for children to make friends so I think it should be compensatory. Thank you.","Oh, yeah, so this is my third question about my topic, which is, you know, is doing exercise good for your health? And yeah, I totally agree with that statement.

In our hectic lives, we face so much stress from work and even in our relationships with friends and family. So, exercising is a fantastic way to handle that stress.

And I’m someone who loves exercising too! The type of exercise I enjoy the most is jogging because it’s super simple and super effective. I can go jogging in lots of places, like in my yard, by a lake, or at a park. There are so many spots to jog around. 

You know, people in my country tend to exercise like that, or they, you know, jog near a lake or in their yard. Nowadays, a lot of young people prefer going to the gym to try out different kinds of workouts. I think the gym is a good choice too because you won’t have to deal with the weather, whether it’s hot, rainy, or even dusty, when you're trying to work out or jog near the street.

I really believe that physical education should be a part of all school levels. It has so many benefits! Just like I mentioned before, it helps kids learn to work together and understand each other's differences. It’s not just about building better physical health or mental health, you know? Physical education also teaches kids to connect with one another and be real friends. It gives them time to make friends, so I think it should definitely be a part of the curriculum.

I think that would be super helpful for us, and we’d gain a lot of insights from them. It's gonna be really important for our next competition, the science competition.

Now people have phones, tablets, and computers, or like small laptops. They can carry it out everywhere. So I believe when a company is considering advertising a chain of cafeterias, the internet is the best option to advertise its product. One thing that internet can do is not only it can be accessed anywhere when there's Wi-Fi or there's connectivity, they can also get surveys and reviews from people that have been to these cafeterias. And with these reviews, people usually look up on the internet what are the reviews before going in. So I believe that this is not only the best way to use for advertisement, this is also a great way to provide people more information about the visuals. That includes the menus, includes the services, includes what people can expect when they go into these cafeterias. So there are a lot of importance that the internet can be helpful when a company is advertising a product. Maybe before, companies still used brochure or TV to advertise. This can still be used. However, I truly believe that the internet is a great source or a great way to just market any business strategies that you would like people to know. Because using the internet has caused a lot of people to get to know more information about certain things, and the internet is also a great way to even navigate surveys and understand how people feel about certain things. So I believe that the company should use the internet and must promote this in every social media mainstream that they could get. It could be YouTube, it could be Facebook, it could be Instagram, it could be Twitter, and even just on Google search. So people that usually search on things, Google can listen to it, and it usually provides or ads pop up on Facebook or in any social media platforms. And I have my experience on this firsthand. So whatever you search most, whatever you talk most, the social media on the internet carries that through and provides information for people.","Okay, so I wanna talk about how the internet has become, like, a super big source for social media. You know, when people need information, they just hop on the internet. I mean, it's everywhere now, right? Everyone's got phones, tablets, laptops, and all that stuff, so they can take it anywhere they go. 

So, when a company is thinking about advertising, like, a chain of cafeterias, I really think the internet is the way to go. One cool thing about the internet is that, not only can you access it pretty much anywhere there's Wi-Fi, but you can also check out surveys and reviews from folks who’ve already been to those cafeterias. People tend to look up reviews on the internet before deciding to go somewhere, so it’s super useful for that.

I believe using the internet for advertising isn’t just the best option; it’s also a great way to give people more info about what they can expect. You know, that includes the menus, the services, and just the overall vibe of the place. The internet really helps companies share important info when promoting their products.

Sure, back in the day, companies used brochures or even TV ads to get the word out, and those can still work, but honestly, I think the internet is, like, an awesome way to market any business strategy you want people to know about. It's made it easier for people to find info about things and helps companies understand how people feel through surveys.

So, I really believe companies should make the most of the internet and promote themselves on every social media platform they can. That could be YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even just showing up in Google searches. Because, you know, when you search for something, Google listens, and then ads pop up on your Facebook and other social media. I've seen this happen myself!

audio/HUST4423NA1U167/HUST0404230062-1.ogg," Oh, we talk about the music. I think that my favorite singer is Dan Do, which is one of the best rappers in Vietnam. I think when I listen to Dan Do, it will give me a very positive thinking. I feel relaxing when I hear him singing. Yeah, for the live performance, I always go to his performance every time I have a chance. I think the last time I watched him in the March, and I watched him in the stadium, where there is a lot of people gathered around him to enjoy his music. Okay, so about the shopping habits. I'm not usually go shopping, but sometime I think once a month I will go shopping. Shopping is not my favorite, so I will come to shopping with my friends, my family, and sometimes my girlfriend. I feel that shopping is not quite interesting, so I need to come with other people to talk with them, exchange ideas with them. These are the reasons why I want to come with my friends. Furthermore, they give me some very useful ideas when I have to choose shoes or shirts to wear in the summer or winter days. When we talk about spending in shopping, sometimes I spend too much on the shopping. Sometimes there are some brand new iPhones or brand new MacBooks, some accessories. I spend a lot of money over my budget and after that I have to save up later. I think this is not a good habit to follow, but I will try to improve it in the future and to avoid buying some not necessary things over budget. This is why I have to talk about shopping habits.","Okay, so let's talk about music first. I think my favorite singer has to be Dan Do, you know? He's like one of the best rappers in Vietnam. Every time I listen to him, it just gives me this really positive vibe. I feel super relaxed when he's singing. Yeah, and when it comes to live performances, I try to catch him whenever I can. I think the last time I saw him was in March at this stadium, and it was packed with people just enjoying his music. 

So, moving on to shopping habits. Honestly, I don’t go shopping that often, maybe just once a month, you know? Shopping's not really my thing, but I usually go with friends, family, or sometimes my girlfriend. I feel like it’s a lot more fun when I go with other people—I mean, I like chatting and bouncing ideas off of them. They help me pick out some cool shoes or shirts for, like, summer or winter.

And then when we talk about spending money on shopping, sometimes I really go overboard. You know, I might end up buying the latest iPhone or a new MacBook, plus some accessories. So yeah, I end up spending way more than my budget allows and then I have to save up later. I realize that's not the best habit to have, but I'm really trying to improve that in the future and avoid buying unnecessary stuff that pushes me over my budget. So that’s kinda my take on shopping habits!",8.0,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD8_1/audio/HUST4423NA1U167/HUST0404230062-1.mp3,CD8_1,1

So I do think teacher assessment is quite good especially considering teacher assessment is for experienced individual to actually have experience in assessing things or revising or the other human resources. Self-assessment is quite opinionated because obviously most people wouldn't want to bring down their own reputation or their level of skills that they often want. They often would want to like have a really good performance in other classmates or other members of the organization especially in the class. They would not want to have like being under looked or being underestimated especially when it comes to soft skills or engagement level or sometimes the attendance. So finally to talk about peer assessment would be the most subjective because it collects multiple opinions of individuals in the class, other students in the class about one or many other individuals including maybe teachers. It could be really accurate the most accurate it's like democratic so yeah I guess I would go for peer assessments. Peer assessments is most accurate to me.","Okay, so I think I’d definitely go for peer assessments, you know, because I believe it’s the most subjective and can really be accurate and precise when it comes to assessments in class or even in an organization. I mean, teacher assessments are good too, especially since teachers have experience in evaluating things and looking at the overall performance, right?

But self-assessment, honestly, it’s pretty opinionated. I mean, a lot of people don’t want to bring down their own reputation or skills. They wanna look good in front of their classmates or team members in the organization, especially in class. Nobody wants to feel overlooked or underestimated, especially when it comes to soft skills, engagement, or even attendance, you know?

So, when it comes to peer assessment, I think it’s the best option because it gathers a bunch of different opinions from students about one or more individuals. And it includes maybe even feedback from teachers too. It's really democratic in a way, and I feel like it can be the most accurate. So yeah, I guess I’m sticking with peer assessments; to me, it’s the most accurate way to go.",8.5,9.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220031-2.mp3,CD3,2

Well, actually I was, I am considering buying a pet from my parents since now they are all retired and they just stay at home and doing the housework without interacting with each other, you know, beneficially. So getting them a pet is a really great idea. So first of all, having a pet is like having a friend. And with that friend they can, you know, of course, first of all, they have to lose them. And they have like a new partner to interact with instead of just with each other. And with that they can, you know, share their dailies, poutine with, share their thoughts and, you know, just make comfy friends that will always be by your side when, you know, other's problems are not available. And I've heard that pets, they are quite easy to chat with. They are the ones that people come to share their thoughts with. So yeah, that might be the case for my parents and for most of the other way. The second thing is it can help release the stress. Now, you know, with the elderly they have nothing to do, they feel bored and when they are in the circle of boredness they just get stressed and they start worrying about their children, their grandchildren, you know, things that they are really like to take care of. But with the pet, right, with the pet they can focus on the pet and, you know, just easing the way out to relax their mind on other issues that their children might get into. Because for most people they don't stay with their children and so they tend to worry about when they stay with the pet. They worry also when they focus on the pet. And when you have a pet, people tend to exercise more and when they go up to another one, the pet will exercise with you. For example, I've seen that many people are taking a dog for the walk but that's not just taking a dog for a walk, they are taking the walk with the dog. Right, so that is beneficial. And another thing is that having a pet for the elderly is like having a child to them. They have the child to experience their most, I would say, the most magical time of their life when they are taking care of their child. They have to know to provide, they have the feeling of nurturing the child again. It is crucial to someone. So getting a pet is a very good idea. And I'm thinking about getting a cat or dog, you know, they are the most popular pets in our country and maybe all over the world. And some of them are very well trained, especially about the dog. They are trained and raised in...","Alright, so, raising a pet. Well, actually, I’m thinking about getting my parents a pet since they’re both retired now, you know, and they just stay home doing housework without really interacting much with each other. So, getting them a pet, I think, is a really great idea. 

So, first of all, having a pet is like having a friend. With that friend, they can, you know, share their daily lives and thoughts. It gives them someone new to connect with instead of just each other. It’s nice for them to have a little buddy that will always be there when, you know, other people aren’t around. I've heard pets are great listeners too, and people often share their thoughts with them. So yeah, I really think that could help my parents, and probably a lot of other people as well. 

The second thing is, you know, having a pet can help relieve stress. Elderly folks sometimes feel bored and, you know, if they’re stuck in that boredom, they can get stressed out worrying about their kids and grandkids. But with a pet, they can shift their focus to taking care of the pet and just relax a bit instead of worrying about everything else. I mean, it’s kind of like they can worry about the pet instead, which can actually take their mind off other stressors.

Plus, when you have a pet, you tend to get more exercise, right? Like, I've seen so many people take their dogs for walks, and it's not just about the dog getting exercise; they’re out walking too, which is, you know, beneficial for both of them. 

And another thing is, having a pet is kinda like having a child again for older folks. They get to experience that nurturing feeling when they take care of a pet, which can be really special for them. So, yeah, getting a pet is a solid idea, I think. 

I’m thinking about whether to get a cat or a dog since, you know, those are the most popular pets in our country and pretty much everywhere else in the world too. Some of them are really well-trained, especially dogs, you know. So, it could be a good fit for my parents.",9.0,9.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD7_1/audio/HUST24223GHH9177/HUST2402230004-3.mp3,CD7_1,3
audio/HUST4523NWMQ167/HUST0405230156-3.ogg," Ah yes, so causes of overpopulation. Firstly, I have to say that one reason why there has been a huge overpopulation in our entire world, including Vietnam, is that there is a decline in death rate. Because we are living in a vaccinated world, there are no kind of disease that can enter the body and kill us. May I say, so the death rate is going down and there are many people are in the ICU with the oxygen boosting machines and many people are maintaining their life through many kinds of ways. Yes, and for that, therefore, I have to say that our world's healthcare system has been better and better every single day. Our healthcare system really focuses on everyone's wealth being and even if you're from the poor family or if you're from a rich family, upper class family, you're still really welcomed to join the hospital and have a health check. Of course, there will be some fee but yes, our healthcare system has been great to our people. And of course, there is this thing called family planning that we are not dealing with really well. We deal with our family planning maybe not really well and that's why many people just give birth to a lot of children and that causes too many babies in the world. And there are many objective sides of it too. Maybe because the overpopulation are now widely populated with older pupils, yes, people from elderly world and that is kind of a depressing thing to our community right now. And we are encouraged to give birth to more child so that a child can produce enough well-being and money and yes, provides enough for the adults and for themselves too. Yes, there has been an imbalance in the population in recent years and what are the negative effects of overpopulation? There will be less water, less food, less of everything, less road, less street, less space to breathe for every single being in the world and in turn, we can cause damage to the ecosystem and the diversity of the world. The animals will be less because our humans are affecting them, are taking their places. Yeah, we have a lot of solution for overpopulation and firstly, we have to say family planning. Family planning always the best care.","Ah yeah, so let's talk about the causes of overpopulation. First off, I gotta mention that one major reason we see this huge overpopulation around the world, including in Vietnam, is the decline in the death rate. You know, we're living in a time with vaccines and all, so a lot of diseases that could really harm us aren’t as common anymore. So, the death rate is going down. It’s like we have a lot of people now in the ICU relying on oxygen machines, and many folks are hanging in there through various means. 

And, I mean, our healthcare system has been getting better and better day by day. It really aims to focus on everyone’s well-being. Whether you come from a poor family or a wealthy one, you’re generally welcomed to hospitals for health checks. Sure, there might be some fees involved, but overall, our healthcare system is doing a decent job for the people. 

Now, another thing is family planning. We’re not really handling that as well as we could. A lot of people end up having more kids than they can manage, which just contributes to the rising number of babies in the world. I mean, on the flip side, we also have an aging population, right? We’ve got a lot of older folks out there, which is a bit of a tough spot for our community. Plus, there's this push to have more kids so they can eventually provide for the older generation, I guess.

Honestly, we’ve seen an imbalance in the population lately. If you think about the negative effects of overpopulation, it’s like there's less water, less food, less space, and even less room to breathe for everyone. It can really mess up the ecosystem and the world’s biodiversity too. Animals are suffering 'cause humans are taking over their spaces.

But hey, we do have solutions for overpopulation. First up, let’s talk about family planning. I really think that’s the best way to tackle this issue.",8.5,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD9_2/audio/HUST4523NWMQ167/HUST0405230156-3.mp3,CD9_2,3
audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220011-2.ogg," Hello my friend. So you have three options if you want to come to Hanoi. The first one is student hostel, the second one is homestay and the third one is guest house. So student hostel is a good option if you're worried that you will have a lot of language problems, which I actually don't have in this country. For example, usually student hostels they have a lot of students from abroad as well, so you will feel there like there's a lot of like-minded people. You can socialize with them easily. It's also usually quite cheap to be honest, so I believe it's one of the better options. The best thing about student hostel is usually living conditions. They normally only have one bathroom for like six people and not very clean. The second option is guest house. I think guest house is quite decent if you... homestay. Alright, the second option is of course knowing someone else in Hanoi and coming to their place. For example, to their house. If you have a friend, of course, first of all it's very cheap and you also get to live like in the proper Vietnamese household. The minus of it is it really depends on your friend. Like if your friend is totally okay with you just staying at his place and doing his stuff, then it should be even better than student hostel, but otherwise I believe you can be a bit disruptive just coming to his place and living like that. Well, so based on what I said, the third option is also a homestay. You can always just stay home, don't go anywhere. Good idea. You don't have to travel to Hanoi, but in general, in general, I think that staying in Hanoi is quite convenient because the food is cheap here. I'd say that living here is cheap in general and I believe you just need to find a place. Oh, another thing I can recommend you, you can actually rent a house. You know, they can rent it for you for like three months if you're planning a longer stay, but my friend, when you're planning to come to Hanoi, call me so we can hang out, go somewhere. These are pretty much the recommendations I can give you.","Hey there, so listen, if you're thinking about coming to Hanoi, you've got three pretty good options, alright? The first one is a student hostel, the second one is a homestay, and then the third one is a guest house. So, the student hostel is a solid choice, especially if you’re worried about, like, language barriers. But honestly, I’ve found that most people don’t have too many issues here. Anyway, the thing about student hostels is that you usually meet a lot of other international students, so you’ll have people around you who are kinda in the same boat. Plus, they’re usually pretty affordable, which is a bonus. 

Now, one thing to watch out for, though, is the living conditions; I mean, they often have like one bathroom shared between six people, and it’s not always the cleanest. 

Moving on, the second option is a guest house, but honestly, it might be better if you know someone living in Hanoi. If you have a friend here, staying at their place is definitely cheaper, and you get to experience life in a real Vietnamese household, which is cool. But it, like, totally depends on your friend. If they’re chill and okay with you crashing at their place and just hanging out, that could be really awesome. But, you know, if not, it might feel a bit intrusive just to, like, show up and live with them.

Now, the third option, I guess, is more of a homestay kinda thing. You can just stay at home and relax, but honestly, I think staying in Hanoi is super convenient. The food is pretty cheap, and living here is, like, overall not too expensive. So, you just gotta find a decent place, you know? Oh, and I should mention, you could also rent a house here if you're thinking of sticking around longer, like for three months or something.

But hey, when you're planning your trip to Hanoi, just call me up so we can hang out and explore together! Those are pretty much the recommendations I've got for you.",9.5,9.5,10.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD3/audio/HUST1411223Y1C166/HUST1411220011-2.mp3,CD3,2
audio/HUST241022SCRI167/HUST2410220048-2.ogg," I think out of the three options to buy a gift for your mother, I think you should gift kitchenware. Mainly because your mum loves cooking for your family and she really enjoys spending time in the kitchen preparing a meal with love to everyone when you sit down for dinner. And I think the other things that you suggested such as the plant or the bottle of perfume, as much as they're nice gifts, I think you can give them for just about any occasion. Whereas gifting a piece of kitchenware such as the mixer that your mother's been wanting to get is much more special and personalized. I think you know perfume and plant is something that people tend to give during like Valentine's Day and other holidays like Mother's Day. But I think for this special birthday probably the personal kitchenware that she's been wanting to get is the best idea. And I think last year you gave her a plant didn't you? So yeah probably you shouldn't repeat what you've given already. And I think with the bottle of perfume it's really difficult to get someone's taste in scents right. And I don't know if it's an easy task today when there's so many options. So I think now that we know that she really really wants this piece of kitchenware it's possibly the best thing you can give. And I think she started watching TV show with Jamie Oliver where she saw another piece of kitchenware that she's been really wanting to get. So I think it's a very safe choice since you know you guys discussed this so many times and we just know that she loves it. So it's a very easy choice to go for and you can't miss it. So yeah good luck. I hope this has been helpful and I guess you can always save the other two options for a later occasion. I think with birthdays it's very important to give something personalized and something that they have a connection to. And I think every time she'll make a meal she will possibly think about you and how you've gifted this piece of kitchenware, this mixer for her. So I think it will be a very nice gift to serve her needs in the long run. And I think it's also an investment these days to buy a really good quality kitchenware since they're quite expensive but I think it will last for a very long time. And yes it will serve her cuisine and cooking for the years to come.","Okay, so I think out of the three options you have for a gift for your mom, you should definitely go with kitchenware. Mainly because, you know, your mom loves cooking for the family, and she really enjoys spending time in the kitchen, preparing meals with so much love when you all sit down for dinner together. 

And I get that the other gifts you mentioned, like the plant or the perfume, are nice, but those are kinda general gifts you can give for almost any occasion. But picking out something like that mixer your mom has been wanting is way more special and personal, you know? I mean, perfume and plants are usually for things like Valentine’s Day or Mother’s Day, but for her birthday, something personal like that kitchenware she wants is just the best idea.

Plus, if I remember correctly, didn’t you give her a plant last year? So, it might not be great to repeat the same gift again. With the perfume, it's also tough to nail down someone’s scent preference, especially nowadays with all the options available. So now that we know she really wants that kitchenware, it’s definitely the best thing you can get her.

I think she even started watching that Jamie Oliver show where she saw another piece of kitchenware she really liked, right? So, it’s honestly a safe choice since you guys have talked about it so much, and we know she loves it. It’s just a no-brainer, and you can't go wrong with it!

So yeah, good luck! I really hope this helps, and you can always keep the other two options for another occasion. I think when it comes to birthdays, it’s super important to give something that feels personal, something they really connect with. And I bet every time she makes a meal, she’ll think of you and how you gave her that mixer. It’ll be a nice gift that meets her needs in the long run.

And, you know, it’s sort of an investment too, since good quality kitchenware can be pricey, but it's gonna last her a long time, right? So, it’ll definitely serve her cooking for years to come.",8.5,9.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD2/audio/HUST241022SCRI167/HUST2410220048-2.mp3,CD2,2

Such as academic knowledge, job opportunity, social skill, and bright future path. Personally, I think about, I really love the university entrance exam in Vietnam. Because when you study for 12 years, and you have to prove what you have learned and what you get in your student life. Because the university entrance exam is the best way to show how or what have you done in your 12 year student. And they could qualify student in many categories. Such as if you good at English or literature, you can go to the C block to choose a school or to choose a university that fit for your advantage. And other students who love mathematics or chemistry or physics could go to the school with a block qualify and they could choose the career they want. How has the Vietnamese university education changed over the last 10 years? I think the Vietnamese university education has changed a lot in the past 10 years. For the past 10 years, there are a lot of change and innovation in the university education in Vietnam. We have more access to the English and we have more connected with other foreign schools. And we have a chance to meet the foreign students and exchange students. So we could learn more about their culture, their system. And we could learn so much more about them. In the last 10 years, students have a chance to be themselves more. They have a chance to go to many extra curriculum activities to improve their social skills, their knowledge and their circle of friends. They are more active, they are more vibrant compared to 10 years ago. The last question. Going to university is not only a road to success. I do agree with this statement. I think going to university is not the only road to success but it's the shortest way to success. Because when you go to university, it's not like 100% you will succeed. But it's still easier when you have a career and you have a job better than when you don't go to university. And you just finished your high school.","Okay, so I wanna talk about how university education is super beneficial for students in a bunch of ways. You know, like it gives them academic knowledge, job opportunities, social skills, and really sets them up for a brighter future. Personally, I really, really like the university entrance exam in Vietnam. I mean, after studying for 12 years, it’s like you gotta prove what you’ve learned and what you’ve experienced during all that time. I think the exam is the best way to show, like, what you’ve accomplished in your 12 years as a student.

And it also helps qualify students in different categories. So, like, if you’re good at English or literature, you can apply to schools in the C block that fit those strengths. And then those who are into math or chemistry or physics can go for schools that match their skills and pick the careers they want. 

Now, about how Vietnamese university education has changed over the last 10 years, I think there’s been a ton of changes and innovations. Over the past decade, we’ve gotten more access to English education, and there’s been way more connections with foreign schools, which is really cool. Plus, students get the chance to meet and exchange with foreign students, so they can learn a lot about different cultures and educational systems. 

In the last 10 years, students have had more chances to express themselves and participate in all sorts of extracurricular activities to boost their social skills, expand their knowledge, and grow their friend circles. They seem more active and vibrant compared to how things were a decade ago.

Now, onto the last question about whether going to university is the only road to success. I totally agree that it’s not the only way, but I think it’s definitely one of the shortest paths to success. I mean, just because you go to university doesn’t guarantee success, but it certainly makes it easier to land a good job compared to if you only finish high school.

With me, a speaker who talk about his or her life experience must be a person that have rich life experience. So, for me, a company president is a person who have come through a lot of life experiences. They have many things to share with us about ways to become successful or the way to get over or deal with the challenges in her or his life. I think as we are the youth club, we are the young generation. We need to be motivated by the positive power. In this case, the company president will help us to realize which way we should follow and how we can achieve our success. For the famous singer, I don't think he or she is suitable because singer is a special aspect. And here, we are youth club. Famous singer is suitable for the group who are fascinated about singing or dancing or something like that. They want to become a singer, so they will need to listen to the singer. However, here, it's the youth club. We include many different kind of members. I think the company president will help us to find our way better than a famous singer. For an excellent student, I think he or she is the same age as us. She or he do not have enough life experience. She is excellent maybe due to his or her efforts. I don't think life experience is enough. My choice is company president.","Okay, so about my youth club, right? We're thinking of inviting a speaker, and I really believe that the best choice would be a company president.

So, I think a company president really fits that bill since they’ve gone through a ton of challenges and can tell us how they’ve dealt with them and, you know, what it takes to be successful. 

I mean, we're part of a youth club, and as the younger generation, we need some positive motivation. A company president can help us figure out the right path to take and how we can reach our goals. 

Now, when it comes to a famous singer, I don’t really think that’s the right fit. I mean, being a singer is kind of a specific thing, and in our youth club, we have members with all sorts of interests. Sure, a famous singer might be great for a group that’s really into music or wants to be singers themselves, but that’s not everyone here. I believe that a company president will provide insights that could help us all, no matter what our interests are.

And for an excellent student, I think they’re probably around the same age as us, you know? They might not have enough life experiences to give us the guidance we really need. They could be excellent because of their hard work, sure, but life experience goes a long way.

Let me see about eating habits. I have three new proteins. I usually eat fur or breast in the morning and this is my breakfast. At lunch and dinner I used to eat rice with many fruits like fish or sauce. In Vietnamese people use rice because in Vietnam it is productive. Rice has many nutrition to bring my body.

Now, about my eating habits—let me think. I’ve got a few things I like there. In the morning, I usually eat pho or some kind of bread for breakfast. Then at lunch and dinner, I usually have rice with stuff like fish or some sauce. In Vietnam, rice is really popular because it’s a big part of our culture and it's super nutritious. 

Eating out can be fun, but I usually prefer eating at home ’cause I can cook different dishes and enjoy them with my family. It just makes it more special, you know?",8.0,8.5,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC167/HUST3110230143-1.mp3,CD16_2,1

First of all, my nephew is… I know that my nephew already has a school bag, and last week I went there, and he also has many toys. He has a lot of robots and things to play with. And he is currently learning English, so I think that giving him an English comic book would be nice. In that way, he can learn new vocabulary, and he can learn new sentence structures and see how it works. And I think I would like to buy him something like… maybe like Spiderman. Spiderman is a whole series of books, so hopefully he can read it and enjoy it, and maybe he gets hooked and starts reading comic books. I think that can be very beneficial to his learning English. For one thing, I think that buying him a robot… robots don't really… they don't really have a school bag. Let me just think. Well, it's not educational, so it might be a waste of time buying him a robot. And I know that he already has a nice school bag, so I'm not even considering buying him a school bag.

That way, he can pick up new vocabulary and see how sentence structures work in a fun way. 

I think I’d go for something like a Spiderman comic. You know, Spiderman has a whole series of books, so hopefully, he’d read them, enjoy them, and maybe get hooked on comic books! I think that could really help him with his English learning. 

Now, about buying him a robot, I’m not really sure that’s the best idea. Like, robots don’t really help with school stuff and they’re not educational, so that might just end up being a waste of money.

That is because learners have, you know, like endless source of videos on Facebook. They can learn through that, achieve knowledge from every source of videos on this. In addition, Facebook is also a source of information. To go into details, many people post their status or share their knowledge on Facebook. So users can scroll the screen per day and achieve for themselves any information that they want and that they need for their experience. And of course, I am not an exception. I spend, you know, around three to eight hours per day to using Facebook. First many reasons I can firstly, I can, you know, read the status of my friends and the page that I follow to, you know, obtain many new trends around the world and about the news of what I am concerned about to, you know, update my knowledge about the current state of everything that happening around me in one day or moreover, a means of entertainment is also another important benefits of Facebook. This is because Facebook is a tool for everyone can connect with each other and this is also a opportunity for everyone to open their relationships. So like you can make friends from other countries and chat with your near and dear people. And for me, Facebook is a tool to help me escape from the hustle and bustle of the chaotic daily life. This is also an equipment measure for me to let off some steam and ignore all my responsibility and burdens of a part of the long work.","Okay, so I really believe that Facebook is, you know, one of the most popular social networking sites in recent years, right? So, obviously, Facebook has a lot of benefits for students, like it can really be a great learning tool. The first thing I wanna mention is that Facebook is, like, an interactive way to learn. This is 'cause learners have, you know, this endless source of videos on Facebook. They can really learn a lot and gain knowledge just by going through those videos.

Plus, Facebook is also, like, a source of information. I mean, a lot of people post their thoughts or share their knowledge there. So users can just scroll through their feeds every day and find any information they need for their own experiences. And, of course, I’m no exception.

I was opening an account but because I'm a foreigner it was basically a lot of hoops and jumps. It was not as easy as for a Vietnamese person. ATEM service in my area works fine. Majority of ATEMs work with the union paycard I use. So do I often shop online? No, not really. I actually prefer physical stores. You know I like to see and sometimes even touch the things I buy. What kind of products are often sold online? Hmm, actually everything is sold online nowadays. You can buy clothes online, food online, you can buy a car online, you can buy services online. I'd say that online is the biggest marketplace right now. No wonder why Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world. So, benefits and negatives of online shopping. First one, it's quick, very convenient. You just hop on your laptop or even on your phone. You look up what you want and you buy it. The second benefit of online shopping is obviously comparing prices. It's very simple. You look up several websites very quickly and then you choose the most fitting package. I'd say that online shopping is in general more optimized because you can quickly look through different variety of products offered. Another benefit of online shopping is usually in many places it includes delivery, which I like. What else, what else, what else? You get very good visualization for some products. For example, a video. You can click on the video and see what you're buying. It's a problem for games. I'd say that in general online shopping is cheaper because they don't need a physical store. They can offer a lot greater discount for their products. Yeah, and the last benefit in my opinion is shopping online. Yeah, shopping online just convenient. Nothing else to say about it. It's good. Everyone does nowadays.","Okay, so hey there! I wanted to talk about my recent visit to a local bank in my area; I think it was called BDIV. The staff there was really helpful, so that was nice. I went in to open an account, but, you know, since I’m a foreigner, it felt like there were just a lot of hoops to jump through. It definitely wasn’t as easy as it would be for a Vietnamese person.

So with that benefit, I think mobile phone should allow it in the class. Because the student can be causing destruction in class when the teacher teaches them. I know mobile phone can help the student searching information the student wants to know and search the word. But there is a few students who have it. But a few of the students use it for studying. But sometimes they can use it for dinner. But the teacher can let the student use the phone if they want to phoning to their parents or searching the information. If the teacher wants to let them use it in class. To my opinion, the age the children allow it to use mobile phone is over 18. Because in this age, the student can understand how to use it. So I think 18 should be allowed to use mobile phone.","Okay, so I wanna talk about mobile phones and their role in the classroom. You know, mobile phones are technology that people use not just for calling someone, but also for searching stuff online and, like, playing games, right? So, with that in mind, I think mobile phones should be allowed in class.

I mean, yes, students can definitely get distracted when the teacher's trying to teach. But at the same time, mobile phones can really help students look up information they wanna know or search for words they don’t understand. Sure, some students actually use it for studying, but you know, there are always a few who might just use it for, like, non-school stuff, like games or whatever.

But here’s the thing: teachers could allow students to use their phones if they need to call their parents or look up information for class assignments. I think it really depends on the teacher’s judgment if they’re okay with that.

Now, when it comes to how old kids should be to use mobile phones, I think they should be over 18. At that age, students usually understand better how to use them responsibly. So, in my opinion, 18 should be the age when they're allowed to use mobile phones.",8.0,8.5,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230273-3.mp3,CD16_3,3

I think you should buy your mother a plant for her birthday because plants are very versatile. With perfume or kitchenware, those items are quite personal and people tend to want to choose those items themselves. For example, my mom likes to walk around in the aisle and touch the utensils to make sure that it feels right in her hand. The same when she is buying perfume. When my mom buys perfume, she sits for hours in the aisle and smells all the different perfumes before she chooses one that relates to her individual taste. Plants, however, can be very interesting and they also last a lot longer. So it can be seen as a forever gift. Depending on which plants your mom likes, you could get her a cactus or maybe a flower or maybe some kind of tree or a house plant. I think your mom would appreciate plants more than she would a random bottle of perfume or a random piece of kitchenware. I would suggest getting her a cactus plant because they are very easy to take care of and they don't need a lot of attention. Yep, good, you get your mom a cactus plant. Or one of those hydroponic plants. Those hydroponic plants are also pretty good little efforts. You can even make strawberries out of them. Yep, get her a strawberry hydroponic plant and then she can have strawberries forever. That's a good idea. Well I wish you luck and I hope a bus drives me over when I'm going back home. But anyway, bye!","Okay, so if I'm being totally honest, I don't think buying her a bottle of perfume or some kitchenware is the best idea. I really think you should buy your mom a plant for her birthday because, you know, plants are super versatile. When it comes to perfume or kitchen stuff, those are pretty personal choices, and people really like to pick those out themselves. 

Like, for example, my mom loves to stroll down the aisles and feel the utensils in her hand to see if they just feel right. And it’s the same deal with perfume; she can spend hours just smelling all the different ones before she finds one that really fits her taste, you know? 

But plants, on the other hand, can be really cool, and they last a lot longer, so you could think of them as a forever gift. Depending on what kind of plants your mom likes, you could get her a cactus, or maybe some flowers, or even a little tree or a houseplant. I really think your mom would appreciate plants way more than just some random bottle of perfume or a kitchen gadget.

Honestly, I’d suggest getting her a cactus plant because they're super easy to take care of and don’t require much attention. Yep, a cactus is a great choice. Or you could even go for one of those hydroponic plants, too. Those are awesome because you can even grow strawberries with them! So yeah, get her a strawberry hydroponic plant, then she can have fresh strawberries whenever she wants. That sounds like a pretty good idea, right?

audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230253-3.ogg," Okay, so topic e-learning is beneficial for many learners. Yes, I agree. Online learning is very convenient. It's cost saving and time saving. And also it's easy accessible. If you have the internet then you can access online learning anywhere at any time. Alright, it's very convenient because you have access to everything at the press of a button and all you have to do is be at home doing the content that is given to you through the course. It's cost saving because there are not a lot of people involved. Like for instance a school system where you have to pay a school for everything. You just pay for the course that you are attending. So depending on what type of online learning this is, is it for a student that's not going to a school but doing online learning in a form of homeschooling. So that is a bit different to online learning for people who already have jobs and who is trying to better their CVs or experiences or knowledge to get a better position at what they are doing. It's time saving because you are at home already or wherever you are and you can access it through the touch of a button. You don't have to travel anywhere like going to the school or going to the university where you have to sit in a classroom or a lecture hall. It saves a lot of time. It's easy accessible like I said if you have internet or a computer or any device cell phone tablet then you can access any online learning from any platform depending on what the online learning is for. Is it for a homeschooling student that needs to go through grade 1 to 12 or is it for a person who already is working and tries to improve their education or their knowledge to get better themselves at work and get a better position. Alright then some follow-up questions. Who may benefit from e-learning the most? Like I said it depends on who it's for. If it's for a student then young children will benefit from it more. But in my opinion e-learning or online learning is more focused for people who are in the working class already and trying to improve their knowledge and trying to improve their work status to maybe get a promotion or to move into another position. What are the disadvantages of online classes compared to traditional classrooms? Right so some of the disadvantages are you are on your own. You have to go through the content on your own and there's no one pushing you and there's no one to ask questions. So if you have a question you have to figure it out on your own. So that's one of the disadvantages for online class.","Okay, so I wanna talk about e-learning and how it's really beneficial for a lot of learners, you know? I totally agree that online learning is super convenient. Like, it's cost-saving and saves you a ton of time too. Plus, it’s really easy to access. If you’ve got the internet, you can basically learn from anywhere and at any time, which is awesome, right? 

It’s super convenient ‘cause you get access to all your course materials just at the press of a button. All you gotta do is be home or wherever, and you can just dive into the content. And, like, it’s cost-saving because you don’t have to pay for all the extra stuff that comes with traditional schools, you know? You just pay for the course you’re taking. 

Now, it kinda depends on what type of online learning you’re talking about. Like, if it’s for a student doing homeschooling, that’s a bit different than, say, a working adult trying to boost their CV or gain more experience to get a better job. It’s time-saving too, 'cause you can study from home or wherever, and you don’t have to travel to a classroom or a lecture hall. That saves so much time! 

And, like I said, it’s easy to access. If you’ve got a computer, a smartphone, or even a tablet, you can get to any online learning platform, no matter what you need to learn. Whether it's for a kid going through grades one to twelve or an adult looking to improve their skills for work, it’s super flexible.

Alright, so for some follow-up questions: Who benefits the most from e-learning? Well, I think it really depends on who it’s aimed at. Young children can definitely benefit, but honestly, I feel like e-learning is more tailored for working adults who want to level up their skills or knowledge. Maybe they’re aiming for a promotion or trying to switch careers or whatever.

Now, let’s talk about the downsides of online classes compared to traditional classrooms. One big disadvantage is that you’re kinda on your own. You have to go through all the content by yourself, and there’s no one there to push you or to help answer your questions. So, if you get stuck on something, it's up to you to figure it out, which can be tough at times. That's definitely one of the downsides of online classes.",8.5,8.0,8.5,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_3/audio/HUST311023LSQF167/HUST3110230253-3.mp3,CD16_3,3

In my opinion, I think I don't want to make friends online because it is very hard to understand them. I want to have face to face with my friends to share our opinions and our expressions and also to understand more about their feelings.

In my family, my parents usually make the decisions, you know, 'cause we all value each other's opinions.

Honestly, I really prefer it when my mom makes the decisions. She’s super calm and always gives me the best advice. So, I feel like if she's the one calling the shots, it's gonna be a pretty wise choice.

But honestly, I'm leaning toward just relaxing at home. Right now, I've got so much going on at college with exams, and it’s super tiring. Plus, I live with my family, so I get to chat with them every day, which is really nice for my mental health. I like talking to my dad and mom about how things are going in school.

Then, when I'm in my room, I can just play my favorite music and chill. Meeting up with friends right now doesn’t really work for me, 'cause I’m already seeing so many people during the week, and I don’t have that much time to take care of my mental health.

I really like to just unwind at home, and it gives me the chance to plan for the next week, too. I wanna focus on growing as a person, so I need that time at home.

A lot of folks might think that relaxing at home is kinda boring, but I really don’t agree with that. You can still connect with friends, whether it's a call or just doing stuff around the house.

First of all, it can help students to improve their communication skills. I mean, that's when they finish the lesson at their school, they're going to play some games, maybe hang out with their friends in some coffee shop to discuss something or maybe trust with their friends. For these things, it can help him or her to improve the way they speak as well. I mean, they will tend to talk and share more in comparison with people who didn't do anything activity after school. The second reason is that it can improve the networking of students. After school activities, it means that they can do with their friends. Their relationship will improve very much. Maybe they will find that this is the best way for them to find their boyfriend, their girlfriends, or maybe girlfriends or their cellmates. The last reason is that it can help them in time management. After school, we have less time, but if they want to do many activities, it means that they have to separate their time. They need to manage their time properly to do all of the activities they want to do. I will now answer some follow-up questions. Some common extracurricular activities for students, like playing in-game high-tech, doing voluntary activities. When I was at university, I joined voluntary groups. It has improved me so much in communication skills, time management, and networking. Until now, they will still be my good friends. I think extracurricular activities should be encouraged because they have students so much. We cannot deny the importance of the lesson or the class, but the importance of extracurricular activities cannot be ignored. It helps students so much in their social skills. The last question is, I think there are some activities or actions we can do to increase students to participate in extracurricular activities. We can organize workshops for students and talk about the benefits of these activities with them. These benefits are on their studies, on their social skills, and their job in the future. Besides that, I think it will depend on the environment more and the friends they communicate with. I think when everything, every student enjoys extracurricular activities,","Okay, so like, I wanna talk about why after school activities are really beneficial for students, you know? First off, they can totally improve communication skills. I mean, after school, when students finish their lessons, they might go play some games or hang out at a coffee shop with friends, just chill and talk, right? All those little moments really help them get better at speaking and sharing ideas, like way more than students who don’t do anything after school, you know?

The second reason is, like, it helps with networking. After school activities usually involve friends, so their relationships really get stronger. Maybe some of them even find their boyfriends or girlfriends, or just better friendships, which is super important.

And then there's time management, which is my last point. I mean, after school, they have less time to do stuff, but if they wanna do a bunch of activities, they really have to learn to split up their time wisely. They gotta manage it so they can fit everything in.

So, as for some common extracurricular activities that students do, there’s stuff like high-tech gaming or volunteering. When I was at university, I joined some volunteer groups, and it seriously improved my communication skills, time management, and networking. I still have friends from those experiences, which is awesome.

I really think extracurricular activities should be encouraged because they benefit students so much. We can't overlook the importance of lessons or classes, but like, extracurriculars help with social skills too. 

And for the last question, I think there are definitely things we can do to encourage students to get involved in these activities. We could organize workshops to talk about the benefits of doing extracurriculars, especially how they help with studies, social skills, and future jobs.

First off, being punctual is super important. You know, a manager wants to see that you're professional, and showing up on time really helps with that. 

And then, there's how you dress. Like, being well-dressed is a big deal if you wanna leave a good impression. It shows you care about the opportunity. Also, I think having a sense of humor can really lighten up the atmosphere, so that’s something to keep in mind too. 

Besides that, it’s crucial for participants to prepare and know all the details about the job they're applying for. I mean, you can do some research online or something. When you walk in and you know what you’re talking about, the interviewer is definitely gonna be impressed. 

You know, first impressions are super important because you have two strangers meeting for the first time, and that initial moment can affect how they see each other. From my point of view, I think your appearance and personality play a big role in that too. 

I guess sometimes people think first impressions are always accurate, but it’s a bit tricky. Sometimes it takes more time and interaction for you to really know a person beyond what you felt at first. You might find that someone isn’t what you thought based on that initial meeting, so it can definitely take some time to get a clearer picture.",8.0,8.0,8.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD16_2/audio/HUST311023PTXC166/HUST3110230105-3.mp3,CD16_2,3

My second topic is advertisement. The first question is, do you like watching advertisements? Why or why not? My answer for that is, I don't like watching advertisements because I can easily find the information for the products anywhere on internet and it disrupts my attraction when I'm reading news or watching a video on YouTube. The second question is, have you ever bought something because of an advertisement? Why or why not? My answer for that is, yes, I have bought something new because of an advertisement because it was advertised on a reliable website and my friends used it before and they said it was good. The third question is, what makes a good advertisement? My answer for that is, the thing that makes a good advertisement is, it must tell the audience all about the details. Especially, they tell the truth about the product.","Hey Teacher, so today I wanna talk about home decoration. The first question is, what’s your favorite color when decorating your home?

audio/HUST311023LSQF177/HUST3110230271-1.ogg," Hi, my name is Rong and I will answer about the evening walk. Well for me evening walk is something really joyful to do. When I was about like 10 I used to have a walk with my family. We will go through some park and my parents will buy me some junk food. It's really cool when you have a time for your family and go for a walk in an evening. But when I grow up I'm not really into evening walk anymore because this makes me feel dangerous when you go outside by yourself and you don't have anyone with you. So that's why I'm not really going outside for an evening walk. But also when I have some of my friends I still going out hanging out with them and it's made me feel better because in an evening you will see the night life of people and you will see that oh something that is not in the morning you can see everything is more slowly in evening and it's made me feel more calm and sometimes it can you know reduce my stress. The benefits of evening walk I'm not really into it so I don't see a lot of benefit but I do think that if you are someone who love to exercise evening walk will help you to you know do your exercise and do your exercise better and evening is not a time that a lot of people hanging out for hangouts so yeah you can try to do your exercise and you know doing some interact with the people that you know and have some drink or I don't know just looking people going around is will make you feel better. So with me an evening walk is joyful memories in a way kids but when I'm older and yet older they may days I think even what is something is make me really exhausted if I'm not in the mood but if I go with my friends I will be for I will feel more fun and want to stay and talk with them so yeah this is my answer about evening walk.","Okay, hi! My name's Rong, and I’m gonna talk about evening walks. So, for me, evening walks are really joyful, you know? Like, when I was about 10, I used to go for walks with my family. We’d stroll through the park, and my parents would buy me some junk food. It was just really cool to spend time with family and go for a walk in the evening.

But, you know, as I grew up, I kinda lost interest in evening walks. It started to feel a bit dangerous, you know, going outside by myself without anyone else around. So, that’s why I don’t really go for evening walks much anymore. 

But if I’m with friends, it's a different story! I still go out and hang out with them, and it makes me feel better. In the evening, you can see the nightlife, and things just seem more relaxed compared to the morning. It kinda calms me down, and sometimes it helps to reduce my stress. 

Now, the benefits of evening walks? Well, I haven’t really thought about them much since I’m not super into it. But I guess if you love to exercise, an evening walk can definitely help with that. Plus, since not a lot of people are out at that time, it can be a nice chance to get some exercise, interact with people you know, and maybe grab a drink or just watch people passing by. It can kinda lift your spirits, I guess. 

So, for me, evening walks bring back joyful memories from when I was a kid. But now that I’m older, it can feel exhausting if I’m not really in the mood. But when I’m out with friends, it’s way more fun, and I wanna stay and chat with them.

audio/HUST310232R9M167/HUST0310230235-3.ogg," I think it's a great idea to make the entrance at galleries and museums free for students. First of all, I think it's a good idea because the students are still learning and for educational purposes, I think that there are a lot of students that cannot afford to go to certain establishments. So if they can make it free, then obviously there will be more students capable of doing it. But on the other hand, I think that it must only be for students and that they cannot make it free for everybody because obviously the people that have the museum or the gallery, they must also make an income to be able to protect and preserve the things that they have in that establishment. But like I said, giving children or young students free access to these kinds of places, I think it can be very beneficial for them. And also, they can also meet people. They can meet people that have the same interests as them. And it's a great way for them to get out and to reduce some stress and to just relax after maybe a busy week. They can go to a gallery, hang out with friends at the gallery. Yes. Oh, and then obviously for the young students, when they go to these galleries and museums, they can widen their knowledge, they can broaden their horizons and learn about new things and discover new things. Okay, so follow-up question. So do you need to answer all the questions? No, you do not need. Okay, so what types of museums are popular in your country? Because I'm originally from South Africa and in South Africa, South Africa is overall very popular for wild animals. So there are a lot of taxidermy museums and like your dinosaur museums. So that is quite popular in South Africa. And then we also have a few history museums and with the history of South Africa, like the people that came from Europe down to Africa, they brought some of that history with them. And so history like that. And then with the history of the apartheid with Nelson Mandela, you also have that side of the history. So there are different kinds of history museums with different kind of history. So it's quite interesting. Let's look at another question. Why don't many children know this? I think that most children nowadays, they don't need to go to museums because they can find all the information online, especially if they look on YouTube or even just on normal television. There are so many programs available on ancient history and on different subjects. You can Google anything. You can YouTube anything and there will be videos available that shows you information on that.","Okay, so I think making entrance at galleries and museums free for students is a really great idea, you know? First off, it's awesome because students are still learning, and for educational purposes, a lot of them just can't afford to go to these places. So, if they make it free, then definitely more students can actually visit these galleries and museums. But, on the flip side, I do think it should only be free for students, not for everyone else, because, you know, the people running the museum or gallery still have to make some money to protect and preserve all the stuff they have there. 

But like I said, giving young students free access to these places can be super beneficial for them. They can also meet people who share similar interests, which is cool. Plus, it’s a great way to get out, reduce some stress, and just chill out after a hectic week. They can go to a gallery, hang out with friends, and just enjoy the vibe. Oh, and when they visit these galleries and museums, they can really widen their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and discover all sorts of new things.

Okay, so now for the follow-up question. You don’t need to answer every question? Yeah, that’s right! So, what types of museums are popular in your country? Well, I’m originally from South Africa, and over there, we’re really popular for wild animals. So, there are tons of taxidermy museums and even dinosaur museums, which a lot of people love. We also have some history museums that showcase the history of South Africa, like how people came from Europe down to Africa and they brought some of that history with them. And then there’s the history related to apartheid and Nelson Mandela too, which is a big part of it. So, there’s a mix of different kinds of history museums, and they’re quite interesting.

Now, let's look at another question: Why don’t many children know about this? I think a lot of kids these days don’t really feel the need to go to museums because they can find all the info they want online, you know? Like, if they check out YouTube or even regular TV, there are just so many programs about ancient history and all sorts of other subjects. You can pretty much Google anything or find videos on YouTube that give you all the info you need.",9.0,8.0,9.0,/mnt/son_usb/DATA_Vocal/CD15_3/audio/HUST310232R9M167/HUST0310230235-3.mp3,CD15_3,3

The first is that apartments are a limited space. It is an area of 40 to 50 meters in area. It must have the full option. It has to include a kitchen, a bathroom, and at least have one bedroom. With that limited area, the space for living and activity will be narrow. It could create stress for people living there. Secondly, when living in an apartment, you may face with problematic neighbors. Such as there were smoke and sometimes they will fight. You can hear all the noise from them. Maybe it will affect your study or raising children when you are near problematic neighbors. Last but not least, we should mention about the pet restrictions. Many people love to have a pet. Especially when they have children. In some apartments, they don't allow pets to live with the family. It may cause noise or pollute the public space in the building. In my opinion, with so many disadvantages, people should consider carefully and thoroughly if they are buying apartments. My first question is which people in your country prefer living in a house or living in an apartment. Why? People in my country love to live in a house because it is more worthy and convenient. Living in an apartment is only benefit single person. Especially when they don't have a plan to have marriage or they don't have a pet. I think in the next 50 years, people will be living mostly in apartments because there will be little space. With increasing population, there won't be enough houses for everyone.","Okay, so my last topic is about the disadvantages of living in apartments, and I wanna argue a bit about this. So, living in an apartment definitely has some drawbacks, you know? The first one is that apartments usually have limited space, right? Like, they’re around 40 to 50 square meters, and they gotta have all the essentials like a kitchen, a bathroom, and at least one bedroom. With that kind of limited area, the living space and space for activities are pretty narrow, which can create stress for people living there.

Then there’s the issue of neighbors. When you live in an apartment, you might run into some problematic neighbors. Like, sometimes they smoke or even get into fights, and you can hear all that noise. I mean, it can really affect your studies or, you know, if you’ve got kids, it can be tough raising them near noisy neighbors.

And last but not least, we gotta talk about pet restrictions. A lot of people love having pets, especially when they have kids, but some apartments don’t allow pets, which can be a real bummer. They might worry about noise or littering the public areas in the building.

So, in my opinion, with all these disadvantages, I think people should really consider it carefully if they’re thinking about buying an apartment. Now, my first question is about who in my country prefers living in a house versus an apartment, and why. Well, most people in my country prefer living in a house because it’s, like, more spacious and convenient. Living in an apartment is usually more suited for single people, especially if they don’t plan on getting married or if they don’t have pets.

Looking ahead, I think in the next 50 years, most people will probably end up living in apartments just because there’s gonna be less space.

If the condition is very comfortable, the clothes shop is often equipped with air conditioning. When I go shopping at lunchtime, for example, in the summer, the weather outside is very hot. Going to a clothes shop is sometimes a method of relaxing with a very cold, very cold climate inside. And also, we can hear some music from the shop. There are some shop assistants or retailers who will give me some advice for the clothes that are proper for me and that are suitable for my requirements. It's very important in a shop that we have the fitting room there. Because my body is not so easy to buy the fit clothes, the fitting room is really needed for me. We can't find this in an open-air market or in an online store. Also, buying in a shop is a good chance for us to change the clothes. If it's the case, we take the clothes home and we discover some problems in the clothes and we want to change for other items. It is convenient if we do that in a shop instead of an open-air market or an online store. Open-air market is very fresh and also very comfortable. But as I mentioned before, it is not convenient in case the weather is not good. It's raining or it's so cold or it's so hot. And also, the items presented in the open-air market are not so clean. Because there is dirt from the air to leave all the items and I don't like this. But the online store is really good.","So, for me, the best choice is definitely buying clothes in a shop.

And you know, there are shop assistants who can help me out, give me some advice on what clothes would look good on me, which is really helpful. 

Another big plus is the fitting rooms. For me, it's really important to try on clothes 'cause it can be tricky to find something that fits well. You can't really do that in an open-air market or online. And if I take something home and find out there's a problem, it's way easier to exchange stuff in a shop than it is in an open-air market or an online store.

Now, I do like open-air markets 'cause they feel fresh and cozy, ya know? But, like I said, it can be a hassle if the weather isn’t great, like if it’s raining or super cold or hot outside. And honestly, I feel like the stuff at open-air markets can be kinda dirty too, with all the dust and stuff in the air—I just don't like that.
