You must cook, you must take care of the children, you must clean the house, you must have something like this. So when I work at the time, it's very boring because my work is no name for me.

When I want to digress some ideas for them, I think social networking and communication is the best choice for me. In my opinion, taking a soft skill course is really nice and I think the best time to learn the soft skills is when you are a university student. For example, when you are a university student, you have many free time and you can go to some clubs and learn some soft skills like communication, make some social network or problem solving skills. I think just learning soft skills is not a trend because it's really nice for people in their work. When you want to solve a problem, soft skills will have many benefits for you and you can solve a hard problem because many people can help you and in your mind, you can think about the way to solving those problems. Furthermore, if you learn soft skills in your job or your company, you can upgrade your level. When you graduate from university, you work in a company, you want to come to a high level, you must have soft skills because it's not a hard skill. If you have good soft skills, I think you will become a senior in job major. But you cannot become a leader because you have not a soft skill in college.

There are several causes of young violence. Firstly, this is media influence. For example, a young person usually uses the internet and we can't control what they will see. Maybe they see a bad video so they actually repeat. The second is lack of parents' supervision because parents spend much time to earn money so children can feel stressed and they will make the wrong decisions so they can make violence in school. The third reason is peer pressure. It's because some people have convenience so they can provide for their children more convenience or a technical device. For example, they may have a bad emotion for poor children so it makes them feel bad, feel angry, and they can be violent to resort. Nowadays, I think young people are becoming more violent than they were in the past because of not realising. To sum up, there are three reasons for young violence. This is media influence, lack of parents' supervision, and peer pressure. The effect of violence among young people is a bad environment for study or for growing up. We can solve the problem of violence with several ways that reduce the media influence. Parents need to care more about their children. I think so.",3,,,,,

Firstly, it is the Faxas Museum provides a rich style of information. It now contains the history of many aspects in our life. Therefore, when students come here they can learn about many things. Secondly, we cannot deny that go to the museum can relax with the students. After a hard day of learning they can come to the museum to reduce stress and widen their knowledge. Not only that, they can go to the museum with friends, they can adjust and feel more connected with their friends. Finally, going to the museum can help share knowledge with others. Because of knowledge with museum content they can help students to grow their knowledge and help them get better scores when they are in history lesson. In my opinion, a museum can also help people love their country because when they know about the history of their country they can feel love country more. I am going to say something. I am going to answer a question. We can organize some outdoor activities to encourage young people to go to the museum. I think in the future museum will be more popular because of its beliefs.

In my opinion, students should take soft skills because when they go to university because after you got academic knowledge in high school or secondary school, you go to university and meet many new friends and you are in a new environment.

When you are sad, you can listen to music like rock and roll, or you can listen to sad music to fall in your sadness. You can't be sad anymore. Some music I suggest is music of Taylor Swift. And thirdly, you can do exercise. When you do exercise, you can forget your sadness. And exercise will make you feel better about your mental and emotional as well. And last but not least, you can go for a travel to somewhere far away, your town. Because when you travel, you will go to a beautiful place and have a funny memories.

The second thing I would like to tell you is that people can access the internet anywhere at any time they want. This means that the time online is flexible for people to shopping. People should buy food, clothes, books on the internet. Finally, online shopping helps people pay money quickly. What's more, people can compare price as shopping. They can bargain with seller by messenger so that they can buy products at cheaper price. Let's move to the next three questions. Question 1. Let me see. I think there are some drawbacks of online shopping. The delivery is late sometime. This is very noisy for people. Question 2. To be honest, there are some things people shouldn't buy both online, actually, food and mobile phones because the products are not good. They expect. Question 3.

Also, if you eat too much, it would be a star in your body which makes your weight keep increasing. All of us know that obesity is not good at all for health. It will help to fasten some disease. However, if you keep a balanced diet without doing any physical activities, it is also not good for your health. If you eat a little bit, you will only stay still for the whole day. Your weight will increase because the income is higher than the outcome. The difference between them would be a star in your body again. Regular exercise is also important in reducing stress for yourself. It will keep you in fit shape.

Electric bikes can improve the fresh air or protect the environment better than a car, motorbike or transport. I think the drawback in electric bikes is more benefit. One more benefit in electric bikes is when the student is not enough, 18 years old, the student can use electric bikes instead of motorbikes or cars. Electric bikes are useful for students 18 years old. When I go to school, I can use electric bikes instead of motorbikes. I want to talk about helping others. I think the benefit to others is very good for myself and the benefit to helping others.",1,,,,,

I think, first of all, teachers cannot know what you do after the screen. You can sleep or you can watch Youtube or you can just open the glass and sleep and sleep and get out of the room. So, since we don't know how you learn, do you hear about the lesson? And about the... what about doing the exam? It will help to find the students who are cheating on the exam or not. Because you will not stay side by side to see them watching when they are doing the exam. You should watch them show the camera and the qualified camera may not be good. But we have to find out whether the students are cheating or not. About the second question, I think online learning will be popular in the future or not. Of course, I think online learning is the future. Now, in the future, with COVID, we will know the advantage of online learning. That way, we can learn from home or work from home. But I only say about learn from home. It will save you a lot of time to travel to school or some money. If you want to go to Kuneya in Hanoi, you have to hire an apartment. That's why you take your money. Online learning, you don't need to do that. You only stay at home and open the laptop and start the lesson. About online learning, about online learning change, about path of a lot of strategies. I don't think online learning exists in a list of six strategies. 20 years ago, online learning only increased when COVID came. It is time that online learning shows the power. When they have people, have the students to continue with their lesson, continue with their project when they just stay at home.",3,,,,,

Because doing exercise can prevent disease and improve mood, every school in Vietnam has some compulsory physical education, like running and soccer.

And I totally agree with this idea. With this teacher, they will have a motive lesson. And with the motive lesson, it's easier for students to understand it and it inspires the students to like learning. Now, with the motivating lesson, the teacher can interact with the student, which means the student can learn better. The second is, they can inspire personality. In school, some students are lazy or they have problems with understanding and maybe they are not good at studying. The job of the great teacher is inspire them and have them to study better. And the third is, great teacher always have useful advice. When the student has issues with studying, with their school, or their real life, such as their family or their friendship, a great teacher will have useful advice so they can have them to solve their problem. And great teacher also have a student more confident, independent, and major. Now I want to answer the follow-up question. What makes a good teacher in your opinion?

I agree and also disagree with the statement because I think the best teacher is also from her and from book.

For example, children can go to public library and read, see, they can make new friends and eat their food. Second, public library is very important because it's natural of reading culture. I think although the popularity of the internet, public library is still very important because it's a whole cultural country and it has a cultural book, so the internet doesn't have it. Thirdly, public library is important because it's safe and healthy environment for learning. I think reading book is good, it's better more than reading book by internet. When we read book by internet, we can't admire it, we can't be first, so we should read book in public library.

People smoking, they feel relaxed and release stress. That is the reason why people work heavy, usually smoking more than normal, like doctors. The second reason is they can learn this habit from their father or their friends, especially teenagers smoking at school. They think smoking is the consequence of auditions. Smoking has a negative impact on non-smokers. Firstly, when the non-smoker lives in the space with many people, smoking can suffer from lung diseases like cancer and high blood pressure.

So that can lead to less communication with friends. But besides that, not everyone has a good plan, good schedule skills to choose what they will do in this gap year. And even the money problems, not every family has enough money for a student to take a gap year. In my country, gap year is not popular. The most people from past to now, what the people usually do is study, 12, study, and after they graduate, they will go for a good thing, and then they will go to the university, or they will stay at home to have their parents at home if their family does not have enough money for a study. But still, there are some families with modern lifestyle, they give a chance for their son, their daughter to have a gap year. Enrich experience or clarify goals for school and work.

Finally, fat foods cost a lot of money. So, to make people poor, I think we should bring children to any of the benefits of fat foods. First, the teacher at the school should raise awareness for the children of the benefits of fat foods to help. And give them an example of the benefits of fat foods.

By passing on her Facebook or making a phone call or sending her a card. So, in personal opinion, I think making a phone call is the best way. For some reason, the very first thing is making a phone is convenient. Thank you, thankfully, for expanding 4.0's environment. So, every person has a mobile phone. So, we can make a call anytime, anywhere. In this way, I can send her wish on her birthday and I can send her a song for her. So, the second thing is making a phone call will help me and my friends keep in touch more closely. This is the best way to keep in touch with my friends. And on her birthday, that is a special day. So, I don't want to miss her special day and I want to say to her a best wish for her. The third is making a phone call is saving time. Of course, that is the best way to talk to my friends in her birthday time. The reason why I don't want to pass on her phone book and send her a card because it is not friendly. Every person can pass on her Facebook one and every person can send him a card. But I want something more friendly and convenient. So, in conclusion, I will do a phone call."

It is suggested that school in Vietnam should start at 9 a.m. to give children more time to sleep and breakfast before class. I think yes they should do that because children is the one who needs more sleep than adults. Most of the children need parents to go to school with them to deliver children to school.

Secondly, it is true to decrease a burden on others. Because the parent has to raise their children and spend a great deal of time and money to raise their children. So when they have a capacity to live alone, the children should leave the house to have their own family and prepare for the life future.

They have to respond with the activities and behavior to deal with the life and how to solve the problem solving. And then they will have more skill and strength mind.

There are some reasons and relevant examples to support this idea. Firstly, after-school activities can help students improve their communication skills. Secondly, when students are in school, they can network with their friends. Last but not least, after-school activities help students learn about how to maximize their time. In summary, it is reasonable to conclude that after-school activities are beneficial for students. And now I will discuss about the follow-up questions. There are some common extracurricular activities for students after school, such as they can join clubs like swimming clubs or English clubs. Next, I think extracurricular activities should be made compulsory for students because it allows students to improve their skills and their learning. And last, I think to encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities. Teachers should encourage them and tell them if it is good for their fathers. And if they take part in extracurricular activities, they can get many skills and a lot of ways to correct their learning. This includes person. Awesome. Thank you.",3,,,,,

Because when you play online, when you study online course, you can have a lot of choices. Such as playing online or go out with friends. So no one can control your time. So I think it's not a bad choice. The second choice, I think it's English class. You go to English class and join it. But there, have a native speaker, have a friend who join class with you. So you and your friend have the same level English. This is easier for the teacher to teach you. So you can improve the English very well. When you join an English class, your response is very very high. You have to go to English class instead of going with your friend, instead of playing game, instead of playing football.

Everyone can have responsibility for their tasks. We don't need to think about the time we are doing the task. We can do the task without any mistakes. We should think that when we do anything, it can affect others. I think modern workers need to learn new skills.

On the views of marriage, they saw on the movies that young people may easily hook up together and call a long time before the real wedding. However, the core habitation before the marriage, I think they will make some limitations. For example, living with the other people will make the life more attention. To share the financial issues, it makes people more stressful. It also leads to the higher rate of separation of the couple before they come to the real wedding.

In my opinion, people usually eat fast food because it's convenient. So there are a lot of fast food stores in the streets. So you can easily come to their place and buy fast foods. Especially if you are a student or an official, you don't have too much time to prepare foods. So you can go there and wait a few minutes, so you will need food for you. Another point is this. The test, many fast foods have a good test, like chicken fry or hamburger. So it's a significant reason that people eat fast foods. More people have good fast foods on their menu. I partly agree with this statement. And I think their meal is more good than good for people. Because fast foods usually contain a high fatty acid, high salt, which causes many problems of health to people who eat this kind of food. This kind of food. So you can suffer a heart disease or anything else when you contain much fast foods. So there are many ways to reduce the consumption of fast foods. But I think that test station is not a good way to reduce. Because I think the people use food for their convenience and taste. So they still use this food.

In the family, we have parents, brothers and sisters, and grandparents and grandparents.

On the other hand, if you take GAPIA, it will recharge after years of school. Learning in school and university is a long time, it makes me very tired and stressed, so after GAPIA, you come to course, travelling, taking volunteer, or learning some new skills like piano, learning some new language, or something that you want to learn that you can do in the university or the school year. That's very interesting and makes you recharge your power and energy for the new job in the future. For another, taking GAPIA will clarify goals for school and work. Some students or the various university students don't have goals or their aim is clarified. They are very unpredictable about their future. They don't know the way you must be.

Secondly, it reduces improve communication skills, and allows many skills such as improving interaction with other people. It makes them become closer.

At the previous time, I just know about this, you know, in the movie, in the drama, but unfortunately it happened in my real life with my cousin. And first thing, I just talk with my cousin and I want to empty with his feelings the first dance. I go to school with him and talk to his teacher because I think in the school, teacher has the important position and if we have any problem in the school, we need to talk to teacher first. Then, you know, the sympathy from the parent is quite important. In modern life, a lot of parents don't have any time to take care of their children. So sometimes the children is bullied at school but they didn't talk to their parents to find a console. Sometimes the last thing, I think, his friends are important too because a lot of students cannot make friends with their classmates. And some classmates burned them because they didn't talk to other classmates. It's not a problem because a lot of students are outside or they have a personal life, different personal life of their introverted people.

A game, a swimming pool, and a football event. I think a swimming pool is my choice because swimming pools help students keep the feet healthy. The most important student can sit there when they fall in water. Besides swimming pools help students to study after hard work. Students can swim with their friends. Besides, on the other hand, a swimming pool and a football event have some advantage. This transition is for a sports facility because the gym is not available for small students. In football, not many people like this because some people can like volleyball, some people can like some students.",2,,,,,

In my opinion, the main drawback of the game in the glad room is that it's limited area and limited time. I mean, we don't have so many time at collage, so if we also play the many games, it affects the starting time. And the second disadvantage is that in collage, it's maybe not enough equipment for playing games. So, when you want to play games, you need to prepare and you need to order some equipment and prepare. The second reason, when should the game be in lesson? Of course, games have also advantage points. For example, in some class, you study 2 or 3 hours. If continue study telling, it could make the people feel tired and sleeping. So, after working study about playing a game for 5 or 10 minutes, it can help people relax and different. After that, they can study better. And the important thing, if you want to game using game in glad room, that means you should link that game with the content of the lesson. That means if you holding have a English class, so the game also use English. So, it will help the student easy to remember what we study about telling. Because game is physical and it's applied in the line. So, if you can using game and lesson the linking, so it's one way to study. Study parallel with the line. And playing game teaching people about the line. Yes, I have a same opinion. Because the study is a theory and theory if you not apply in the line, it's that theory, it's that inside your mind. So, playing game is a way you express what you study to the actual people. And the playing game is one of the way you study. And the, nowadays, the training code, normally they have a combined theory training and have a game between the training class. That is a great method for help the people can concentrate and also can get more effective.",3,,,,,

I think the government can raise awareness of having healthy diet in my country by having many TV shows about healthy diet. And, a plan helps people have a good awareness of why we need to have a healthy diet and a strong body. I think regular exercise is more important for people's health because it can keep them weak, weak, and more likely to have to refresh and recharge our battery after a long day of hard work. So, I think regular exercise is more important.",3,,,,,

My mother is a teacher. She teaches in Yantfoot school. My brother is a photographer. He has a store in Park Linh and Yant Fong. I am a student of academics. My major is banking. I am 20 years old. My favorite is football. I play football everyday with my friends. I listen to music in my free time. I can learn English everyday. I can apply for school listening, reading, and...",3,,,,,

Well, I would like to talk about the advantage of foreign language. To me, the first language, the first advantage of foreign language, foreign language, give me some language for my work. Secondly, an author by his cultural understanding, he called foreign language is a public language and it's very easy for some people when they work as office. Finally, I should then forget Google CTZ. This is clear that foreign language has some advantage. Well, after I have some questions in this speaker 3, after I have one age, should children start learning foreign language? For me, the age should children start learning foreign language after 6 years old. Because 6 years old, children will start school and recent for English. Secondly, do you think parents and school have the same role as particular prior children of foreign language? I think parents and school have the same role as individual children of foreign language. The second language, a bridge, is called parent. If parents help children with some homework, wait not teach the kids after school. Secondly, what is my learner's role in learning a new language? It's the new language, learning a new language, this is called hard, it's not good for children even study. So I think the alpha 6 forest language has some benefits for this idea.

Online learning is the important platform in the future. The online learning has changed over the last 20 years from text documentation to video documentation.

I think in recent days most children have lunch in the school canteen because the lunch in the school canteen seems to be cheaper and then the other lunch in the restaurant or in the cafe. And the second year having lunch in the school canteen will be a time savings because the students have lots of stuff like and class in the day so they are just have a little bit time after the class in the morning and before the class in the afternoon. So I think lunch in the school canteen is very convenient and time-saving for students. But lunch in the school canteen also have the disadvantages. So because the food in the land of the school canteen is not changed and diverse and a little diverse than the food in the restaurant or food in the cafe. And maybe some children can eat some food in the school canteen so they have to go out to buy their favorite food. So it is some advantage of having lunch in the school canteen.

So it's a nice way for me to gain energy after a long day of working. In summer, I like to go to the beach or maybe spending time with my family and spending time with my friends too. Because I love both my family and my friends. In Vietnam, in holiday we usually go to the beach or maybe to the mountains. Because this is a normal way to spend a holiday. Especially when you go to a holiday in Vietnam, we usually have a tour. We have a tour guide, so he guides all of us in the area. He introduces us some food, some new food and some delicacies in this area. Just spending time together as a family. This is a good way to gain energy.

As you know, with the development of technology, people in some place where they cannot come to the real school, they can use the high technology to get the knowledge via online class. It may be helpful and useful for us. Back to the Covid-19 time, I think online learning is the best choice for education. In that case, people cannot go outside or go to school. That is the only option to avoid stopping education for children. As I told you, because of the development of technology, online learning has changed many things during the last 20 years.

Because it has many things to do. You know, Won Kim Lake is one of the famous places for tourists. It has many places to go instead of Won Kim Lake. You can also come to the Park Bo Gar nearby. And around the Won Kim Lake, there are many entertainment for you to play. I think that Ho Chi Minh is okay, but not the best option. Here, you come from the Dynasty to Hanoi, and then you must take another flight to come to Ho Chi Minh City. I think that it's not good for your pocket. Hanoi Museum is another option. But in my opinion, you need to be quiet when you come there. I know that you are an active person, you want to talk, and this kind of place doesn't fit you. Also, around the Won Kim Museum, there are not many places for you to entertain. And not so many restaurants, not many good restaurants to eat. So, in conclusion, Won Kim Lake is the best solution for you. Thank you.",2,,,,,

Benefits of teamwork can establish strong relationships Because if we have a team and we don't have strong relationships, we can't complete our project. Secondly, benefits of teamwork improve communication skills. Because when we work in teamwork, we can communicate with each other more than work alone. We have to discuss about the problem and provide each idea and discuss about it. So our communication skills are improved. Thirdly, benefits of teamwork develop leadership qualities. Because every team also has leadership. So the leadership plays an important role to develop teamwork. Also, leadership can develop the skills to lead their members of teamwork. So in my opinion, benefits of teamwork can help our solve the problem more quickly than work alone. Because we have a team and we have many opinions, many ideas from other people on the team. So we can solve the problem quickly than work alone. So the next I will answer the question following up. When working in the team, some possible problems such as conflict ideas, conflict communication, the member team has trouble with each other.

First, let's talk about the lack of family planning. Well, about these reasons, I think that when people don't have the rich family, they don't have the issue about the money. So, they just like the children and they have babies. And with the poverty family, they don't have enough education about having the babies. So, they just have sex and make up babies that lead to the cause of overpopulation. With the death rate, let's talk about the best health care system first. Now, the health care system has improved so people can live long-lasting and so that leads to the death rate is declined and decreased. So, leading to that, the population is high and the young people are born while there are old people still living. That leads to cause of overpopulation. Now, I will answer the follow-up question. The negative effect of overpopulation, I think that is the job opportunities. Because the job required is still there, but the people are more and more so that the competitive job chance is high. Is it more difficult to get a job? To solve this problem, I think that the government and the school should educate the people in the local and to the global about the family planning.

First, using recording the teacher richer is too easy to do in the class. We can prepare for that before the class starting. So, you can recording on the notes or in the class sheet. The second, if you forgot something about the class, you will open the recording of teacher richer to study. Which that way you can improve the skill with the class.

For example, for me, the thing that makes me unhappy, for example, when my father is dead, when I was young, or maybe I failed an interview or a job, a test, or when I see my mom cry. And number 2, childhood is the happiest time of one's life. Do you agree with this view? Yes, I totally and completely agree with this view, because when you are a child, you don't have to worry about money, about anything, you just meet you. You can do everything that you want. If you make mistakes, you are corrected by your parents, your relatives. And the price you have to pay is very cheap, it's not expensive. As when you are a adult. Number 3, in your opinion, is money the most important factor in achieving happiness? My opinion is mostly. I often hear a sentence like, money is not everything. But nowadays, we have to face the fact that money can buy many things. And the thing that can buy money is not all my happiness, but they can make me happier. And number 4, when you have money, you can buy a big house, you can buy a lot of things that serve your life, and your life will be very convenient.

Every day, you can come back home earlier and you have a friend to play with you. Secondly, I think your husband will have more support for you. You will not allow.

First is that sometimes they want to smoke to reduce their stress. Some people are smoking because they want to have some when they are boring or something. Smoking has many problems. The most important is health. When smoking, they have many problems in their health. Not for them or for them, it can have negative impact on their health. Other with not smoking especially is children. Secondly, the problem of smoking is that it is a bad image for the children. Children tend to present their parents or some people they imagine. If their father or mother is smoking from them, their future is good. So they try to smoke like them too. Thirdly, smoking can cause environmental pollution. Many people after smoking throw away their glass in public areas, not in the trust. This can cause many problems. I think the government should ban smoking in public areas. Like Singapore or Japan, they ban people smoking in areas to prevent health risks for non-smokers and to protect their environment. In my opinion, the government needs to prevent the children from buying smoke or eating it.",3,,,,,

By using a phone, laptop, or textbook, it's very good and fast. Secondly, a student can get better time with their own government. Secondly, the student can spend time playing games to enjoy the program course. Then, the student can take care of his family and play with everybody in his family. Finally, the student can get better academic performance. I think that students can get an academic boost up-round, up-round, and can get an academic cheap or free. In my opinion, I think self-study skills are very good. When I was a student, I spent time to study self-study skills. I spent a lot of time in source. I think self-study skills are a benefit for students. For example, more independence, better academic performance, better time management, and I think self-study skills are more and more popular in the future. Thanks for listening.",3,,,,,

The main topic is the causes of overpopulation. The first cause of overpopulation is the lack of family planning. In many countries, especially in Asia, families tend to want lots of children. The more the merrier. They usually want at least two children in a family and in the rural, there might be more like five to ten children in a family. The second reason is the lack of family planning because there is the lack of sex education in the lower-income countries. The second point is the better healthcare system. Nowadays, the healthcare systems are very developed. If you have a health problem, you can always go to the hospital. The health insurance is quite developed in many countries. The third view is the decline of death rates. Because the healthcare system is better, the decline of death rates is also higher than many years ago. For the follow-up question, what are the negative effects of overpopulation? The negative effects affect the environment, like the air pollution, the water pollution, and the negative effects is the lack of work, especially in big cities. What can be done to solve the problem of overpopulation? One of the solutions is to provide sex education in every country, especially from the standard school for the students. Do the developing countries suffer from overpopulation more than the developed ones? Yes, I think the developing countries suffer from overpopulation more than the developed ones.",3,,,,,

Sometimes it's not good for the people, they have less money or sometimes they have less time for waiting or sometimes they need to fast to fit the clothes. I think the best choice is buying in the shop. It can support the world for choosing and maybe changing the idea when we're fitting is not fit. In conclusion, if some people ask me about choosing the place to buy the clothes, I will choose the shop. Because it's useful for not only choosing the testing but also for the price of bagging because I have not so much money. That's all my speaking test.",2,,,,,

Many people believe that group work helps students learn better at school. Firstly, learning from others, where we have children enhance teamwork skills. Moreover, they can get some information and some specialized skills from other people. Secondly, group working will improve communication skills in a group containing many people. Students have many face-to-face chats with their friends. Therefore, they can widen their friend cycle and they will have good mental health. Last but not least, working in the group helps students become more active. They will have to talk in front of many people. If they practice this skill many times, they will become more confident. When they do more activities in groups, they will sum up. Working in groups brings many benefits for students. For the question, when should workgroup be used as a school, I believe it should be used as a school such as in summer to go to work. In summer homework, the teacher can bring some homework in a week. The teacher can do in a group to improve social skills. Working in groups not only has advantages, but also has some advantages such as disagreement between group members or group members. Secondly, working in groups is consuming a greater time or a job than people doing it alone. The teacher can improve the quality of the group work.",3,,,,,

Besides, it is a variety of goods for me to choose. So I like to go to the market. I have been to a music festival because I don't have enough time and money to go there. But I hope in the future I can go to one music festival. Well, I think I prefer to go with someone else. For example, my family or my friends, we can prepare things together to get there and we are sharing the feeling of it. Also, we have many things to talk together. In my opinion, people like music festival because it has reduced the trade after a long starting or working day. And it makes them more happy."

Today I have an important elective exam. My situation is waking up early. I really agree about that because of some reason. First of all, when we are waking up early, it really helps keep our team happy for us because when we are waking up early, we can do everything we want like go to the gym or walking in the park or eat breakfast. I know some people because they don't have time to repave before to work and they don't eat breakfast. So when we wake up early, we can eat breakfast and do something else for our life. Secondly, waking up early really makes us feel fresh because when we wake up early, the air is really fresh. We can go to the park and watch the flower or smell the air in this park. Besides that, when we wake up early, we have increased productivity because when we are up early, we can do anything we want. We can plan and check it. First of all, we can go to the park and do everything we want when we wake up early. Besides that, I think waking up early is really good because when I wake up early, I can't have a lot of time to do anything. I can't make up or feel comfortable because when I wake up early, I don't need to travel in travel. I have a lot of ways to go. Now I will answer some questions about this benefit when we wake up early. First question is, do you think people pay enough attention for their hair today? In my opinion, I don't think people pay enough attention for their hair today because there are some people who don't always eat unhealthy food or something else. Question three, why do you think people continue bad habits even though they know they are damaged their hair? Because I think they don't have a lot of time to do everything for food healthy. To sum up, my situation is that waking up early is really good for us and I really agree about that.",3,,,,,

So people can eat fast food for a lot of fast food that can gain weight. Secondly, lack of nutrients of fast food like sausage, cheese, french fries are really just meat and not vegetables included. So that's why it lacks a lot of nutrients for our body needs. Causing disease is the most important and for me the most known consequence for fast food. A lot of people are causing a lot of disease from fast food like heart disease, bone disease and a lot of it. Because like I said the first time it's made a lot of oil so eating fried things and getting your waste. Getting your waste means that you will have a lot of fat in your body that is affecting your body from the neutron, from the heart attack disease. Also from my view as a developed country, fast food is also consuming a lot of our money. In here we have to spend a lot of money to buy fast food like hamburger compared to our traditional food. So it really costs a lot of money. Most people that I know from here, from my country, really prefer to have traditional food than fast food. Because it's more healthier and less time and also importantly it's really cheaper than fast food. Most of the developed countries like USA or Europe are consuming a lot of fast food. I see that people in their countries are having a lot of troubles with fast food. Although the economic of their fast food has increased amazingly but the disease and the health problem are still there. Fast food shouldn't be bad in school for me but you need to control the quality and the fast food that is consumed by the kids. So that's all I need about fast food and for me fast food is really harmful to our health if we can't control it.",3,,,,," Fast food is one of the most iconic and very well known from all over the world.

And the education is important, you see, in the life. And in the education classroom, it has become popular in the class in a lesson. About the disadvantages of using it in the classroom, I think that if the teacher don't know how to use the time to improve, we will lose the time to teach the knowledge for the students and the effective learning is not good. And using them in the classroom maybe cause an accident. For example, the student runs around the classroom, they can't see a lot of people, so they can be hurt for students in the class. And then in the classroom, it depends on the student. In the class, almost the students are active, they don't like the game to reduce the stress in the class, but some students don't like that, so I think they will just like to enjoy the game. The way the game wants to be used in the lesson, the teacher has to based on the lesson, the student. And the time for the game, for example, you can spend 15 minutes for the game and 13 minutes for the game and 14 minutes for the teach, you can reduce the time for the play game. Playing games, teaching people about life, I think this is true. For the game, you can teach the student the behaviors, how to treat for a parent, for grandmother, grandfather, for younger sister, for sister, for brother, for everyone. Thank you.",3,,,,,

Firstly, salary is important because money can help we pay anything. Secondly, job satisfaction is necessary. With Scott, it helps me to correct what we want. Thirdly, promotion opportunity.

So you must choose what job you want to do. So I'm answering some questions. Question 1, I think the relationship with your co-workers will influence my performance at work. With Scott, if we are co-workers, we can relax and be comfortable. So it helps me improve work. Question 2, I think the reason young people nowadays with jobs is in recent have many choice to work.
