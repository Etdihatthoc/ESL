I think the most suitable option is the first one, finding smokers at least 500,000 Vietnam Dongs because this option has two advantages. The first one is you can let the smoker to... You can let the smoker... You can capture the smoker on the street and let them to take... To give money right away and it's very quick. It's very convenient and it will make people on the street see about the situation and they will not smoke on the street, on the public place anymore. The second option I think have the disadvantage is everyone is now very busy with working and they will have no time to do community service. I think if we use this option, they will have the resistance to the policy and they will not accept it. And the third option is sending smokers to the prison. I think this is too heavy treaty. The smokers is not a very serious... Smoking is not a serious thing to take the smokers to the prison.

Firstly, living apartments cost half limited space. It is evident that it does not have many entertainment space or it does not have many trees or parks. Therefore, it makes people feel not comfortable and relaxed. Second, it creates a pressure stress for the brain or for children's development. Secondly, it has problematic neighborhoods. Actually, the person who is living in an apartment does not communicate with others. It is difficult for people to get along with people around them. Finally, living apartments also ban past restrictions. I think in many apartments, it does not suggest cat adults because it is very noisy and influence on other people. I think the most demerits of living in an apartment is that it does not have a market. It is not near the market. Therefore, people go to shopping the supermarket very too much. It does not have necessary things to adapt. However, it is not possible to live in an apartment because it is very facility. Thank you for listening.",3

I think the best choice for me in this situation is to have a talk with her for the following reasons. Firstly, I am older than my youngest sister so my voice will have a strength to convince her not to tell lies anymore. However, it is an easy way to let her understand the consequences if she tells lies with other people. However, moreover, it is a way that lets her unable to get confused with her. I can talk to her with a soft voice to her so her can understand my feelings. On the other hand, there are some reasons why I opt against informing my parents and letting her continue. Firstly, if I inform this problem to my parents, they can punish my younger sister. So it may lead to the conflict within my family. It is the conflict between my parents and my younger sister as well as an aggressive emotion in my younger sister towards me. In addition, I don't let her continue because if they continuously tell lies, it will negatively affect the relationship, the sisterhood relationship.

Firstly, by living independently, teenagers can create their own confidence. They can boost self-confidence. They learn how to be more confident when they live independently. Furthermore, they can decrease the burden on others by arranging things for themselves. They don't depend on the others too much, especially on their parents or family members. Thirdly, they can be more responsible for everything that they decide to do. Furthermore, in order to live independently, they learn how to live well from the difficulties. When they have difficulties, they learn how to arrange things by themselves. So all in all, living independently creates a lot of benefits for teenagers. In order to do that well, parents teach their children. This day, parents teach their children to live independently. Gradually, they teach their children to do things by themselves, like arranging their own room, tidying up things, putting away the toys, cooking for themselves, taking care of the dinner for the family, and doing household chores. In the future, teenagers in Vietnam will have more opportunities to live independently because thanks to the parents' teaching and thanks to this day, a lot of communication this day, they are also well educated at school about the way they can live independently. So parents play a very important role in helping their children live more independently. For example, parents can set the target right from the beginning, since the children were born, until when they become teenagers or even later, that they should do things by themselves. They can even be concerned with the parents, but they need to take responsibility for their own decisions. Parents should also work as a guide or as a friend to show them what is right or wrong whenever their teenagers reach to them for advice. Parents also don't let the children or let their teenagers do everything by themselves without any guidance or control. Parents should leave privacy or freedom for teenagers.",3

And the boss of Champagne, I don't think he likes to drink Champagne. So I will choose a cup. I will choose a cup because I think it's easy to buy suitable spice. And especially my manager is interested in coffee. So if we have a Q cup or a convenience cup, it's so perfect. He also realized I care about his hobbies and our relationship is better. I think he will like this present. I think Champagne or flowers will have in the past. If I buy the same, it's not special.",2

It is a magazine called Vogue, I don't know if you know it, but it is a very famous magazine that takes place in many countries and is a main course in the US. The reason why I think it is very interesting and enduring is because I like clothes. I would say I am a very introverted person and I like pretty things. So pretty things and the performance of a person and their clothes and their makeups will very intricately through time and Vogue is like an inspiration for me and for a many mild knowledge I want to seek in the future. It's just like a hobby. The online magazine is like a more affordable way I want to read a magazine but traditional papers magazine will give me more creativity. I have bullet journal and if I like to have some pictures of the magazine I can cut it out and stick it to my journals and create more beauties and more art. I mean art is not limited so I can cut and paste and do everything I want. The benefits of reading this magazine is it giving me more of a well known act and I don't know like it's giving me more of an open minded to the world. For example I didn't know Milan is a capital of Italy until I saw it in Vogue and some mild knowledge about the brand the history behind the person that created that art. The magazine is giving me more of a story and the stories behind every each of art is this art is what you brought to yourself and giving the person what personality you pursued what is your statement in life.",1

As I said, I still choose to work at a travel agency because of the pro ad follow-up. First and foremost, I would like to say that when he works at a job at a restaurant, he can communicate with everyone from other countries. It is an opportunity to develop skills and language. Besides, the restaurant is here many times to learn every skill and practice his English with my father. Furthermore, I think that at a restaurant, he earns money more easily than others.

In here, people are very friendly. So less but not, Hanoi is very beautiful. You can go to Ho Wan Kiam to relax after Hanoi. On the other hand, there are various reasons why I don't choose another option. Sabah is not my choice because Sabah is very quiet to my home. First of all, the weather in here is very cold.

Instead of earning money through a job, you will spend time to practice or doing something that does not give you money. I think the benefits of taking GAV years is that you can learn another language to have a new job. You can have a chance to clarify your career, your goals and to find out what you really like to do. Because for me, sometimes to work or to do what you really want, it is more important than to earn a lot of money in a job that you don't like. You have to do it as not your hobby. You have to stand it every single day when you wake up. It will be very stressful after getting back from work. Taking a GAV year will help you to recharge your batteries, take care of yourself, your health and prepare for all your goals. If you are a postgraduate, after a year of university or schooling, you can have a year gap to prepare for yourself and what is coming next. There are some disadvantages of taking a GAV year. You will waste time in doing nothing. You will not earn the money. You will be dependent on your parents. Taking a GAV year is not popular in my country. The majority of people will be in school or university. You have to find a job immediately to earn money, to raise yourself and to prepare for your future. You will have a husband and wife and have kids to take care of. That is why taking a GAV year is not popular in my country. I think that there will be more and more students in my country taking a GAV year because of their own opinion and living style. The generation Z now is very different from others from the past. They can do whatever they want or they can be a freelancer while doing a job at the house.",3

The husband and the wife have more divorce because they don't have their equal roles in the family. In the past 10 years, the wife always makes their household in the family. They take care of your children. They have working outside. They took care of your family. They have done more and more activities in the family. Opposite, the husband only earns money when they are working outside. When they come home, they don't have the childcare responsibility. They don't care to share the household with the wife.

I think that in the family, the husband and the wife should have equal roles. It's a basic equal stage. The husband and the wife should share their role in the household tasks.

For example, I have been to zoo's in Harlow when I tried. I think when I was trying, I saw a lot of animals, but I feel this animal is not happy and it's not unhappy. And especially the elephants, when I see in this zoo, the elephants are really not as attractive. I think it's not good.

So I think the reason for that is we keep them a lot in the safety like zoo's and a long time they will lose a lot of survival skills and when we feed them some, they don't have any skills. Yes, it's really bad for me. In my point of view, I think we don't view zoo's, we just view national park like Kufu National Park. In there has enough areas, space for any animals in this place and we can go through and go out, go to travel, to see them and see them like happy and satisfied with their life. I think so. So this advantage of keeping animals in the zoo is valuable. I think governments should view more national park to keep animals, that's to keep animals a lot in the zoo. That is the end of answer. Thank you for Thank you. Thank you. [REPEAT] ",3

There are many kind of pro-fits of teamwork at Einone. First is improve communication skills. For sure you have to if you are in a team you have to communicate with each other especially with your leaders to know more about your roles, the tasks which is deadlines and what you should do to complete your tasks. Moreover to give someone advice or some feedback so you have to communicate with each other to share the ideas or to receive other feedbacks. Another pro-fit is establish strong relationships. As a group you can communicate with each other and after some tasks you can hang out with them and in the range of time that you have a chance to meet with each other you can know more about their behaviors, their emotions and it's a good way to build new relationships. If you are a leader of a team it can be a good way to develop leadership skills and it can be an additional point for you when you join a new recruitment. Other benefits of teamwork I think is that you can focus more on the tasks because you are in a teamwork you don't need to do all things of a task and you can focus on one part of task and it helps you to make the presentation better. So when you join a team there is some possible problems. It may be like when you have a conflict with others so maybe your team will be broke if your leader or you and your partner does behave good when have problems. So communication is key on the team when overcome some fight or some conflict on a team. To promote teamwork spirit in an organization. The organization can view some extra activities to get each other to know more about their teammates by taking place some team building activities. It can make people feel relaxed after work and can be a good way to to communicate with others. I think that the statement teamwork is more important for others than for children. It's not actually true. It is important for all of us.",3

You can meet people in other countries, talk to them so you can boost your confidence. Also you can meet some people in other countries. So no need to develop your country's sensitivity. For me, a person should prepare his trip to another country. He should prepare a visa. Also his foreign language. Especially you need to communicate to people there. When a person travels abroad alone, he can face various challenges. He should prepare with a person who is not good at foreign language. He can also communicate with people who are not good at English. He cannot communicate with people there. He can ask them where to eat, where to store, where to eat, hotel and so on. I think the traveling habit will change over the last 10 years. Today, every person I know tends to go to the beach. Over the last 10 years, they could travel to the mountains or jungle, which has a breathtaking view. I think the traveling habit will change over the last 10 years.

And the mood, the teaching and the listening, the one who takes part in learning, the one learning and the teaching is more, can have the benefit from this online learning. They are so convenient, it can be denied. They are comfortable, you can sit and stand anyway, so you can still take part of the course or you can teach it. The teaching, the course, the work, it changes the way people learn. It will become more self-learning. But because you can directly listen from the teacher, you must actively find yourself. Find yourself, actively find the topic to learn. In online learning, I think people require to make a lot of presentations, which before, the teacher did not allow, not much to do that. So if the student gets a lot of presentations themselves, they try to learn themselves, that requires a huge advantage of this online learning. So, why before, the directly learning, the traditional learning, teachers do a lot of jobs and why take all the time to tell the learner about what they should listen, that is a way of quite passive. And as I said, the online learning will be more popular in the future, because like I said, the both the learner and the teacher get the benefits. It is so flexible in learning time and the both the teacher and the learner and the student will have the time to have a flexible learning time. Yes, and you can study or teach teaching anyway, and it will be lower the cost of education, requiring no, it doesn't need to take place, it doesn't need to take place, some place which I think is going to require expense. And I think more of that in the future will be like technology, that you can be study like in the classroom,",3

That is the best way to improve our relationship. And sometimes I think I will enjoy relate at home with my family. Because after a long hard work we need time to relate and charge energies.

I think this activity is really, are really good for any kind of student because it is some skills that you will, that you need for the life, for the life in the future before coming to the job. But I think it is not necessary for all students to do some, to join some activity, to join some extra activities because not all the students have the time to join there. They often have to take a part-time job as well as a full-time one to gain more money so they can pay for the life and pay for the curriculum. Anything paid for curriculum, for example, some students that have, that their family is not so rich and wealthy, they have to work very hard, day and night, to gain more money, to receive money so that in the final semester they can pay for the university, for the school, the fee. I think it is, there are some, there are some ways, there are some solutions that we can do to encourage students to participate in curriculum activities. As I said before that people, the students who have to deal with the fee of university or school, they do not have time, they do not have time to take part in any activities. So if the school, if the university have some scholarships for them so that they do not have to take a part-time job, I think it is one of the, it is one of the way to solve the problem. The other way to solve that, to solve this issue, that we can tell them about the benefits of some extra activity, like if they can, if they could spend time on studying new languages, they will, together with the club, they can in the future.",3

To do the project well, three suggestions are offered. Going to the countryside, watching it on the internet and reading books. Which do you think is the best choice? Well personally for me, I would say option one, going to the countryside to experience that for yourself. The way they do things, how they do things is just better than reading about it on the internet or watching videos on the internet and reading about it in books. Because your imagination can only take you so far. So if you go to the countryside and experience what life in the countryside is all about, then you have that deeper connection with the countryside. So countryside and living in a city is opposite sides of a coin. So the countryside are mainly quieter, so not a lot of people, not a lot of traffic, obviously not a lot of pollution, so less pollution if you live in the countryside. Some disadvantages of living in the countryside is there is not a lot of work opportunities, that's why most people leave the countryside to go to the city for work. But if you live in the countryside and you make a successful life there, it is wonderful living in the countryside, a breath of fresh air every morning, seeing the landscapes, tending to if you have animals, crops, depending on what you do in the countryside. So for me personally, if you want to do a project about life in the countryside, you'd have to go and experience that for yourself. Because reading about it and watching videos is not the same, you have to have that smell of fresh water on the grass or on the soil. So definitely to do the project well you need to do, to go to the countryside and experience that for yourself. The internet and reading books can only do so much, your imagination can only do so much, but you have to actually be in the countryside to experience it in full and give your full evaluation of what it's like to be a person.",2

They're still teachers too, but mostly are students, which they are not having lots of money because they're not working, they're still studying, right? From individuals. To me, it is harder to meet many, many individuals for you to talk with, so you can raise money for the charity. I still think the best chance is from companies, where you can meet lots of people at the same place. At the same place. So you can raise more money from people who have more money. One more benefit from raising money from the companies is most companies are going to have funds, they have funds to do things, such as for charity or organizing some special day to charity.

The first reason is that living independently will boost their self-confidence, because when they do not depend on anyone, they have to deal with themselves. They can do everything with themselves, and that's why they can boost their self-confidence, because they believe that they can do everything, and they have to build their confidence and tackle every problem in their life. For example, my parents leave a lot of independent places for me, for me in choosing my opportunities or choosing my job, my majority, my major. That's why when I have to make a decision, I'm really confident and I always believe in myself. And the second one is that living independent will have you gain more responsibility with your life, because you're not living by anybody's decision, you have to live by yourself, and you have a responsibility with your life. So you have to be more responsible with anything of your life. The last one is that living independently will degrade burden on others, because when you depend on someone, you will be based on their facial expression or you can be based on their decision, their feelings to decide what you want in your life. But living independently, you will reduce the burden on others, and you put that burden on your shoulders, because you have to decide everything. You have to choose every single thing that you want in your life, so everyone will not have the burden on thinking about you. The ways parents teach their children changed, I think that changed in the past 10 years. In the past, people wanted for the children to be dependent on them a lot, by a lot. But now, people can assign the decisions, opportunities for children, such as myself. My parents gave me an opportunity in choosing my university, choosing my major and my career in the future. And they encourage the children to make their own decision to living independent on the decision or it's financed. I think that nowadays, teenagers in my country have more opportunities to live independent in the future, when they can make their own decisions in many things of their life, about their career, about their finance, about their jobs. Because of education, now it's really developed, and parents realize that there are a lot of benefits if they give the independence for their children in the early age. So that's why teenagers in my country have more opportunities to live independent in the future. And what are the roles of the parents who have made their children live more independently? I think it's two roles. The first one is about the direction, and the second one is create opportunity, so the parents can make room for children to not depend on their parents or finance or anything in their life.",3

Moreover, students who don't know how to manage money will feel difficult because living far from home is so expensive. Food or travel is very expensive. Moreover, you can get potential dangers such as bullying. Nowadays, more and more students are bullied because they can't protect themselves. I remember vividly that my best friend who studied abroad as a master linguist, she always called me and said that she can't manage her life abroad because she has to experience a lot of things a day.

The atmosphere is very bright, everyone is happy, and with the lavender morn, I can see the joy of the couple. They all have been so happy for the new experience. To talk about the clothes I wear when attending the wedding party, I think we all believe that we should wear the formal ones. I remember that as far as I got concerned, in the Western tradition, we all often wear the dress card of the house. However, in Vietnam, we just dress whatever we want, colorful dress or anything just be formal. I even sometimes see some kids wear the informal clothes to the wedding party. But yes, I think we can wear anything to the party if we feel that it is comfortable. So now I will talk about my favorite Vietnamese actress.

For textbooks, because this textbook will help people to have a clear information and that people can gather information easily. However, picture books have helped people to be imagined about the situation and beyond the text itself inside the books. So it promotes the creative person who is reading books. For reference books, in contrast, you can see there are so many texts there that are more academic and help people to study in detail deeply on the subjects and also on what they are studying on. For me, the best choice would be the picture books which help me to both gather the knowledge of what I really wanted to do and also help me to be more creative.

Firstly, it's a good chance for challenging oneself. People can have some challenge which will make them feel more... make them feel alive. Secondly, learning a new skill can help people live a more meaningful life because it can help people avoid having too much leisure time and become more lazy. Moreover, some new skills will help them have more friends while they are learning and help them broaden their relationships. Thirdly, learning a new skill also improves their brain function. They will be more intelligent because they will learn more new soft skills. They can easily enrich their knowledge and they will know many things around their skills. Moreover, learning a new skill will help them feel more confident when they have a new skill. It is really useful if they want to get success. They can find a job with high salary with their skills and I think it is really really suitable for people.

You can earn high income and they will ensure your job security if you have a useful skill. I think it depends on each other. Some people will feel illfull when they attend a training course.

But there are several impacts of smoking on non-smokers or even smokers. First of all, smoking will make the environment pollution. Because smoking is harmful and it has nicotine, you can make air pollution. Since you are smoking, other people around you will also be distracted. Secondly, smoking will also make your health become quicker and it's also a risk to your health. Smoking has been researched that smoking will destroy your health and the more you smoke, the more your health is getting better. Thirdly, smoking is a bad affection to children and not only for their health but also for their image. If you get the interest of smoking, they will be more conscious about smoking. They will learn to smoke like adults. In my opinion, the government should ban smoking in public places due to several reasons above. Firstly, the government should ban smoking in public places like the streets, schools, workplaces or hospitals. Secondly, the government should control the consumption of smoking by managing the amount of smoking that can be sold. That's all my ideas.",3

It also enables the doctor to have a more modern method to discover the disease. Last but not least, the beneficial approach is because there are more strange diseases. It is more effective in the strategy to help people be stronger. I will explain the reason why I reject the final two options. Many people believe that improving private hospital and setting is good.

Well, first of all, souvenir craft are quite small, easily transportable by plan and also they are very unique. You have to go to Nha Trang to get them and cannot be buy from other places. Rice seafood are quite nice and seafood are my daily source. They are easily purchasable in the markets near me and furthermore they are pretty smelly and can go and go fast quite quickly. So, transport things from Nha Trang, my home might not be from Nha Trang, a long distance from my home might not be the best idea and local foods, local foods, the local foods can also be buy at my local supermarket and they are also even more easily, they are even easier to go best than the rice seafood. They get rotten very quickly and go best furthermore and in addition to that, long transport distance, my resource in many of them being grass because of other objects crossing into it or restricted space and the like which make it more or less just a mess and they are quite cumbersome to carry. So, and I don't want to or bother my friend with that kind of trouble. So, in my opinion, a souvenir's craft are beautiful, they are unique and they cannot be found anywhere except Nha Trang. So, in conclusion, I think that are all the three options. I will ask my friend to buy me some souvenir's craft. They would make for nine, so I have 89 keeps and would make for nine, and would make for nine decoration in my living room.",2

Internet become popular now. Especially smartphone. As a modern student, I use my smartphone or mobile phone all day. I use my smartphone to learn English and to chat with my friends. I also listen to music when using my mobile phone. But mobile phone have some disadvantages. Firstly, if you use mobile phone much, it can affect your health, especially your eyes when you look at the screen too much. It can affect your sleep.

Because sometimes no people knows who you are in the social media and that's not the right way. And when having a talk with those fans in person, it's actually the first step to solve the problem. Like when in a person we know how emotional they are, how the voice they are, and we can control the emotion when we talk face to face.

Human players enjoy watching something made by art centre. Art gallery is a place where we appreciate the art. We feel it relaxing. It is also my own idea. Art in education is also important. I think it is an aspect of history. Students can learn through art. Through art art, in the time of art, when it was created, what happened in the time. So they can more appreciate the art and improve their knowledge about history of art. I think it is important to encourage young people to go to art gallery. I think that school might perform some events. I think that a few research in art gallery that encourage students to research about the history of one art. Art gallery shows students will have more vivid insight about the story, in the background of the art. In the future, I think art gallery will be more popular.

When working in a team, there are several problems. The first one is that when working in a team, the participants could think that other people will do their part in the group so that the responsibility of the individual could be reduced when working in a team. The second question is how to promote teamwork spirit. I think when working in a team, the leader has to divide the work into small tasks and then every member of the task has its own task and gives the member a deadline to complete the task. Another method to promote the spirit of teamwork is that when the leader could give the member the passion present and the money could be promoted, money or promotion would enhance the spirit of the member in the teamwork. The last question is I think teamwork is more important for adults than for children. I think for children, in their childhood, it's the best time to set a behavior, set a good manner, set a skill in their teamwork. In childhood, when the child is in the teamwork, it's easier to set the skill necessary for teamwork. When the skill needed for teamwork is set, they will bring many benefits for children. I think for children, it's also important for them to develop the skills needed for success in school or success in life later. I think teamwork is more important for adults than for children.",3

I am going to talk about the topic of the benefits of fact-folds. Firstly, it is obvious that fact-folds save time. Because we don't cook at home, therefore it is good for saving time. Secondly, it is the fact that fact-folds save money. And it is a half positive. It is more costly. Finally, we cannot deny that fact-folds are having worst deaths because it stops. I think three aforementioned opinions are comprehensive. I cannot think about the other opinion. To sum up, I strongly believe that fact-folds have many benefits. The students tend to consume more food because they have known many times and money. Fact-folds have been inhabited in the past few years. For example, we don't need cooking at home. We don't need internet to use other foods. There are some disadvantages of eating fact-folds. It is not good for physical health.",3

The first thing I would say is that traveling by plane is very fast. Because if you want to move from Hanoi City to Ho Chi Minh City, you have two hours to come here. And the second is traveling by plane is convenient because you can use some supplies on the plane and suggest either food, drink or maybe you can relax in here. And the third and last is I think traveling by plane is suitable for long distance. Because about the two hours you are in plane, you can use some supplies in here, about the drink of food, and you can sleep or reading a book or listening to music in here. Even you can sleep here. So there are some advantages of traveling by plane. About the two other disadvantages of traveling by plane, I think is to maybe lay the focus, the plane depends on the weather. Because when the weather is raining or maybe it's cloudy, there are many cloudy places in the plane, and there are delays, and it's the effect of the times or the weather, or the storms or the trees. So one more convenient way of traveling by plane is the plane can save time when you are moving on to the forest. I think plane is the best, most popular means of transport in the next 20 years. Because in the recent years, about the economy of the people is increasing, people can pay or some people can pay for tickets to the plane, use the survey interview.",3

They can equip washing machine so the students will don't have to wash their clothes by hand. And I think they should free the charge of water.

I think I would like to agree with this idea because there are several reasons why handwritten letters will disappear in the future. Firstly, the mobile phone invention is too blamed. When people have mobile phones, they can check and send messages to everyone and it's very fast and convenient. They don't have to write and receive a book of paper or letter. They just turn on the phone, check and send. Secondly, the social network website is another reason why internet development of the social network website becomes the forum for people to communicate to the website and they can make friends, they can talk and chat on that social network and they don't have to write down the paper and fold it in the envelope and send it to the post. The tradition is quite complicated and the new book talk through social network website is fast and convenient. Thirdly, email is a great invention of humankind. You just need to write an email or what they want to do or what they want. The job application is sent to the one who wants to send and it's very formal and convenient and fast. Why do some people still prefer handwritten letters? Because I think it's about the emotion. When you send and you receive a handwritten letter, you can feel sensory signs or the sensory or the apologize of the writer. How do you think people will communicate with each other in the future? Yes, communicate is one of the fundamental demons of people. They communicate with each other not by vocal but by the text or by the email or by the website and by many ways, but they still communicate with each other. This was a fun thing of using your mobile phone.",3

Why you may ask? I would say because they have money other than from other choice here, like from school. I don't think schools have much money to spare and from individual. I don't think people are actually concerned about the other people unless it has impact on them. And also the money is quite small and time consuming, asking for one to another. So company is the correct answer here for me. They usually care about their public image and we can use that to ask for their help in raising money. They also have quite a lot of money.

In my opinion, it's not only reason for damage to environment. Overpopulation is growing in some locations like big cities in some countries, growing countries or developing countries. And we can see the effect like the way to mass in a big country and lower women effect. And with bigger population and growing population in the world, the natural resource will be used too much. But in the other hand, the way we use natural resource like water or anything, the way we use is more important than our mouth. We can't use natural resource because we use too much and we don't have any solution to recover or reduce the resource. So it will be more difficult for our next generation to live in there. The biggest group of people that are influenced by overpopulation in the world, some poor countries like South Africa, they don't have enough resources to protect their land. And the first is Randa town, running out. So we also need some group of people in the lower class, even in developing countries or in big cities, they also have not enough resources for their life.

High living causes potential dangers in the criminals, the robbers, the big cities. There are a lot of problems in the college, but I think the most is about the homesickness and the high living cause. We have to pay a lot of money for living in a big city when we attend college. And about our health, homesickness is also a big problem. Homesickness, we also have some sickness especially in the hot weather, so there are a lot of dangers. When we are at home, our parents will attend our health and if we have some problems, the parents will realize. Because we are a teenage, we often look at the problem very easily and not understand how serious it is. For me, I prefer to have a far away college because I live in a small hometown and I understand that only in the big cities have a big college environment for us to develop and become a bigger person. Also college is a place where we learn skills and learning about life too, so I think in the big cities, I will have a chance to understand much more about it. About the statements, going to college far away from home brings you a chance to get out of the comfort zone. It's a true statement because living in a family is very comfort. Our parents, they pray for us a lot of things so that we don't have to do and we just have to be responsible for learning jobs. And when we go far away from home, only us right now and our parents can help us in all jobs we have to do it by ourselves. So we can learn a lot of things that we haven't learned at home. We can learn how to cook a meal for us, how to clean our dirty clothes, how to deal with the problem when something happens, how to be a girl man. So I understand that getting going far away from home is very very important. And also college is a place that we develop to become a girl man, we be different.

Animals are used to living in the wild area and by keeping them in the cage, they lost their freedom and you can imagine if a person lost their freedom, it makes them a prisoner. The second is the zoo always lack of space for animals. The wild area always lost and they can have a lot of space for them, their daily life activity. In the zoo, the animal is rejected in the cage and as a result, they may become inactive and tired. For example, when I go to the zoo in Hanoi, the animals are always sleeping because they don't have anything to do. Another thing is that animal keeping in the zoo is lack of survival skills. For example, in daily life, they don't have to hunt to have food. The food is for a tiger, it's dead and it feeds them directly and immediately. If they go out of the wild area, they don't have the skill to trade and to hunt the animal and they become something like a home tiger. The zoo now has many kinds of animals and you can find any type of animal like an elephant, a giraffe, a lion, even a snake. Keeping animals in zoos has got some benefits. If the animal is on the edge of extinction, you can keep or it doesn't have good health. Keeping in zoos means you can monitor their health and preserve the animal's species. However, my suggestion is that we should build more preserved areas like the safari. By this time, you not only protect the wildlife species, but also people have the chance to go to see the animal and learn about the wild natural habitat. To protect wildlife species, I think the government has issued some policy to prevent people from hunting and imprison wild animals.",3

When reading books, I can find out many information about the next lecture and I can review about the knowledge I got to teach before class. Now I am quite busy in university so I need time to research and read more scientific research to get a good mark in the semester. I found that talking to friends and doing exercise is quite a good option but I think that when you are doing exercise, you get enough time to do anything. You can just lose some patience when you are doing exercise. I think talking to friends is quite bad because it can make noise and loud in the glass. So it is a bad effect to other people in the glass. I need to beat food, atmosphere to get enough information about books and other lectures in the glass.",2

Besides that, the information of this book very large there are more information of this book so which will good for my knowledge. Besides that, with the picture book I think the information of picture book is limited. I just received one or two details from a little picture book and with reference book, I think the reference book produce a high level knowledge so it's enough for all students. It was useful for a high level classes but so sometimes students encourage to this kind of book say they will forget the base information, the base knowledge.

The first thing is going to work. The second thing is that you can study your master and you can find a place to go into travelling around the world and you can look at the people around the world to do. I think the best choice is going to work. Going to work is a way you can earn your money and you can support your skin and own your experiment in your graduate at the university. Do not use that as a way to go to work. It is a problem with your education because you can meet other people like your supervisor, your co-workers and you can enter time or you can have many many new experiments in your working as a company or as your project in staff. I think that is the best choice and we have no mention about studying your master or going travelling. Going travelling, you have no money to do that. I think the best choice is going to work. That is one of the own studies for four years at the university. Of course, when you are working, there is something inconvenient. For example, some of your co-workers are not very happy but this thing is good in your experiment. I think that my brother can get more experience when you choose to work.",2

The study abroad can be a better university for the students. The major difference is that the university is not good as the university in the country. There are some fields or departments that do not have the investment from the government. So, studying abroad to another country which has the investment from the government in that field is very specific. But also, the study abroad can cause some disadvantages. First, the student must study and learn from the family. For the students who are living with their family for a long time, being apart from the family is quite hard. They will have to adapt to the new environment, new friends, and in a new country. So, that may cause a shock for them. That will affect their studying process. Besides that, studying abroad costs a lot of money. A lot more than the university or study in Vietnam in the original country. So, they might have to have a job or maybe a second job to work part-time to get the money for the school fee. Or they might take the loan to get approved to the university. So, when they get the loan after they graduate from the university, they have to pay it back. And that will cause them some problem or some disadvantages on the way they work. Especially when they just starting their business when they graduate from the school. Some people said that this is saying the statement that going to college far away from home brings a chance to get out of your comfort zone. I totally agree with this statement because there are lots of disadvantages, lots of drawbacks. And you have to solve those problems. You have to deal with those problems to get involved in life, new life. And that makes you become stronger and when you get out of your comfort zone, you become stronger. Thank you.",3

Firstly, it helps students to relax after long periods of hard studying for exams and tests. Another important benefit is that it improves their historical knowledge as many pieces of art are based on real historical events. Another advantage of this activity is that it helps students to appreciate works of art by artists. Also, going to art galleries can help students understand more about both traditional and modern arts, therefore improving their art skills and artistic evaluation skills. Another advantage of going to art galleries is that it can also increase the bonding between friends. It helps them understand each other more and it really helps them to incorporate with others. It helps them improve their co-working skills. Another advantage of visiting art galleries is that it really helps improving inter-communicational skills with the students themselves. The importance of art in education is really unnoticed. I mean, art is a really important subject because it helps students to improve their logical thinking skills, their artistic eye, their artistic evaluation skills. To encourage young people to go to art galleries, I think that art galleries should provide and host activities for young people to encourage them to visit art galleries. In my opinion, I think that art galleries will really not get more popular in the future as nowadays there are many other forms of entertainment and people tend not to go to art galleries that often. Nowadays, I don't think that art galleries would attract more people in the future.",3

Second, if a student has just a comment, they don't know how they are and have no motivation for the next test. In my opinion, we should have both marks and comments because when we have both of them, if children do a good test, teachers could bring a lot of encouragement and comments in their test. When I was a kid, if I had more motivation and feel happy and do better for the next exam, I think it does wonders for the mental health of the students.

The soft skills are is also important because within the CUTSIGUAGE technology, the young children tend to focus on working with the machines instead of using the communication or interaction with other people. So this is also their weakness. Learning soft skill is one of the most important things for students before graduating because they need to prepare for their work. Moreover, the soft skill cost is not too expensive now and it's within the budget, so every student can cover it. And even in some universities, they provide this kind of cost for their students, so it's good news. For instance, when in a workplace, maybe we meet some conditions and some problems with in communicating with other customers or even our boss, other staff, other colleagues, so communication skill will assist us to be calm and calm down and think before talking. This kind of skill will be useful, especially in the workplace. So I think to be to prepare for the future, we need to learn the soft skill cost.

It's like it's like it's me to step out of my comfort zone and know about each other, how to interact with them, how to communicate with them and how to understand each other in a workplace or study place.

Our homes are no longer a safe place to live because we use our computers there, we use our phones, we use our laptops and other electronic devices which are connected to the Internet.

Invasion of privacy does not only happen through hacking but it can also happen through spamming. People can spam your email and send links to you. So if you're not careful and you fall into a trap, a lot of things can change. People can have access to your financial information, your bank accounts and your phone.

I'm going to answer some question. Talk and cat is the best popular in my country because it are easy to race take care of them and it is the loyal friend of people. I think bad are well in my country because in my country people have well know enough how to take care of bad and kill the bad. If they have a sick or deary I think people will spend money on the bad in future because they see bad like a friend so they love them and they can spend more money to take care of bad and buy something to bad playing and if they have sick or deary they spend much money to take them to hospital.",3

I myself always try to study as much as possible in case that not only from the work. At work I always try to study on job training. Also from my colleagues, it brings me a lot of skills and knowledge to support my work. But I think that besides what we study new things from work, we also try to study on other skills. Like maybe to help life much better. For example, I myself try to study new things several years ago to try to wonder the most difficult thing in my mind in the past that I could not swim. But I try to learn swimming in a very aggressive way for several months. And now I can swim almost all styles of swimming. Like shapes, like four kinds of swimming styles. In another case, I also try to study what is not really my profession. For example, I am now working in the IT industry, meaning that it is purely technical. However, I try to study economics as well to gain more experience and also support me in investment activities. So now, in case I try to invest in the stomach kit, now economics, knowledge, help me a lot to analyze and also to find the best companies in the stomach kit to invest. Another case to invest that I try to study to gain more knowledge, not only from books, from friends or colleagues, but also on the office search and cost. It could be the offline training course or even I can buy online training course to improve my skills as well. I think that people now they not only focus on relaxing, but they also try to learn new skills to support them better in the future.",3

What are the benefits of wearing uniform at school? As I said earlier, the benefits of wearing uniform definitely would be the guarantee of equality at school. Inside schools, the equality should be ensured among students so the friendly environment among students can be created. The mixed schools would have different students from different backgrounds and the equality among students should be taken seriously and should be at the top of the school's authorities' agenda.

I have three ways. Taking notes using bands, taking notes by phone, tablet or iPad and recording the teacher's lecture. In my opinion, the best way I choose is taking notes by iPad. Because some following reasons. Firstly, taking notes by iPad is very convenient. I can take notes every lesson in my class on my iPad and I can bring it to everywhere to read my notes. So I don't have to bring many notes books to class. Second, when taking notes by iPad, I can focus on the lessons while I take notes. Therefore, I can understand the lessons better. I don't choose another option because taking notes using bands is not convenient. I have to bring many notes books and pass to class for different lessons. Taking notes by iPad can be safe in a long time. Besides, recording the teacher's lecture may make me unfocused because I think I can listen to the lecture again at home.

A good park can create when they have a clean environment with no trash, with a lot of equipment for people to do the exercise. And it has to have a lot of trees in the park to create a clean environment. The second one is what are the benefits of going to the park. Whenever you go to the park you can release your stripes after a hard working day. At the beginning of the day you can get the relaxed. After a hard working day you can release all the stripes. You can look at the sky and see how beautiful it is. It can also increase your mood. The second benefit is that when you go to the park you can connect to other people. Sometimes when you have some problems it is really beneficial for you to go to the park to see how others do with their life. Sometimes they can share with a stranger with your stripes.

And it can give me lots of vitamin C, which is important for my body. I would like to eat one of my favorite types of food. Not only because it gives me lots of vitamins, but also because it's very delicious. It is very important to eat food because it helps us healthier. In some research, people eat more food, have better health than others that don't eat food at all. Food is not only for old people, but also for young people. I think when people are around 10 to 20, they need to eat a lot of food. They help people increase their mental health and physical health. And with teenagers, they need to increase their energy and vitamin C to develop some function. And they will last to the end of their lives. So food is very important for teenagers.",1

The price is very cheap and sometimes I compare with other price at the shop. Almost items cheaper than other shop. Second point is time saving. Of course, because students after learning in the morning and they have the course in afternoon, they have the short time. Sometimes from 11 o'clock and 1 pm. It hit home very far from the school. He will take time to mark time. I believe that the students have learned at school can save the time for him. Third of all, the third part is convenient. Because it is very effective and useful.

Actually, I'm not really a foodie, so I rarely go to restaurants to eat. I really like the Thai restaurant near my house. Not because of the taste, but because of the hospitality and reasonable price. I think that's all. Because of the Thai restaurant, it's Thai food properly. I don't really like all of them, because they are too spicy for me. But the food is really on another level. Especially the Thai noodles, the yamacha noodles. They are soft with the food, and we can get plenty of it. I think that it's free too. It's free on the house, so that's another great thing. I also don't enjoy playing games, because it's bad for my eyesight. However, I realized that I bought them with my family. I lose often, but I think that it's a very fun experience.

Many people are on a healthy diet because the in that area a life drive make them to make them bigger and faster so they have to raise awareness of having a healthy diet in the world.

It makes the house more organic and environmentally friendly. It can attract a lot of unwanted insects like mosquitoes, moths, and oxygen when you are sleeping. A perfume is a great gift in my opinion. It is usually considered a feminine product. Mothers love a good bottle of perfume. It helps her smell great and feels great. One of the cons is that designer perfumes can be very expensive. The cheaper options are usually not very good. It can make you have rashes and it is very itchy. The last option is a piece of kitchenware. A piece of kitchenware, for example a knife or a cutting board is very practical. In a sense, if she is cooking a lot. But if someone doesn't like to cook, then it is not very practical. The pros here is that it is usually cheap for a knife or a cutting board. Or even a set of pots. In my opinion, even though a bottle of perfume can be somewhat expensive. But if you really love your mother, then you should spend a little more. Because a bottle of perfume can be used in a long span of time. Not a short time. So I think the bottle of perfume is the best option. Thank you for watching.",2

It has to be a worker to establish strong relationships. When you work in a team you have a common goal and people can communicate to reach the common goal and when they have the common goal they have a better relationship. Secondly, teamwork can improve the communication skills. When you have to deliver or exchange the idea between the members you have to have better communication skills. You deliver the easiest or the understandable idea to another member and will make your team better. The third one is teamwork can develop leadership qualities. Leadership is about leading other members. When working in a team you know how to lead the other member to reach their common goal. And finally, also the most important is that teamwork makes the outcome of the project or the process better. When working in a team you can have the advantages of each member so you have the most powerful tool to choose who is doing what and who is doing the best in this situation. And you have the best in the best and you create a team so it is easier to get a better outcome when working in a team. But working in a team has some possible problems. I think there are some problems like when the people in the team do not divide the work equally and they have some envy when the others have much less words, when me have a lot of work. And also working in a team for some intelligent people they have that when they contribute a lot to a team and the whole team gets the reward. So they feel they do not satisfy it and they do not have any encourage to work in a team anymore. So teamwork has many benefits so how can we promote it in a team? I think that we will divide the workers in a team and we introduce them with the better benefits. We will show them the benefits in a team that when as a traditional ideas or traditional stories about the teamwork is used in this case. I think teamwork is important for both adults and children.

Good teachers also encourage students to give out their ideas. The good teacher never say to the student that your idea is unrealistic, your idea is bad, or something like that.

The students can have a lot of relationships. When we have a team, we can do anything. Some rich students can have a lot of money to organize this. I think the second option is a second-hand market. Not many students use a second-hand market, so we don't have enough money to help poor students. The third option is a marathon. I think it's not suitable because a lot of students don't like to run.

In my opinion, there are some factors that make people feel happier. The first is the strong friendship. I think you can have many friends. It's a good way to improve my mood and my health. When I share my talk with my friends, I feel that it's very comfortable. So, I think a strong friendship is a good way to get happiness. The second is the sense of belonging. The sense of belonging means that the thing or the way you feel is very near to you. I think the sense of belonging is that you can visit people you like or go somewhere that you love in the past. The third factor is the inner peace. The inner peace is a time when you don't make noise. Last but not least, I think the happiness is that you can do anything you like. For me, I like reading books, listening to music and playing games. I found that when I do this thing, I feel very comfortable and relaxed. I think doing the things you like is very important to build happiness. Now, I will talk about the follow-up question. The thing that makes people unhappy is the feeling of work, bad weather and the noise. The noise can be from traffic, the connection, the ride or something. I completely agree that childhood is the happiest time in one's life. Because in the time when my children are kids, I can join many things with my friends and my parents. In my view, I think money is a very important factor to achieve happiness. Because when you have money, you can earn and pay for the things you like. It makes me promote you to do other work and make more money. When you have money, you can do many things with other people, like raising money to the poor and build up the house for your parents. So it's enough. It is all.",3

Now, when a student lives on campus, firstly, it is really convenient for him or her because she or he can go to school on foot and moreover, maybe they have not to get up much early to go to school because the campus is really near from school. Secondly, I will discuss about the networking. When students live on campus, it definitely helps them to improve their relationship with their friends and they can easily make friends with people on campus and this friend totally can support them in study in the future. Totally, when you live with your loving friend, it can really build a strong relationship between people. I think friends in life are really necessary and important for everybody. Moreover, living on campus can definitely be good for students because of reasonable cost. When you stay away from your family, you have to move to another country and if you rent some accommodation or house, it is more expensive. Mostly, students don't have much money to rent expensive accommodation. So, living on campus really helps them to save their money and they can use their money to do a lot of other things like buy food, buy some gifts to their parents. I want to discuss more about the advantage of living on campus. Maybe we can understand more about the university rather than other students.",3

We go to a factory and we have lunch together and talk about life, about the future. It is the day I remember the most. Question 2. Universities now, the same art, they were in the past?

My volunteer group is organizing to help children in remote areas. I have three options to help suggested books, clothing and money. Which option do you think is the best choice? In my opinion, books are the best choice because of the following reasons. Firstly, I have a very old book in my house. Books have children as a knowledge book. Books are very, very digital. Because books are free and I find children's books everywhere and every time. I don't choose to have children's clothes because children have food. Clothes are very expensive and have very color, size, large and I don't choose the type of clothing. I don't choose money because I have money in the time. Money is very low-health for children because children are young. Besides, I choose books because books provide children every knowledge, vision and vision.

So have you wondered, have you think about the accommodation? I think that's some of the choice. Homestay maybe? Guest house or luxury hotel? In my opinion, homestay is the most suitable one for you to choose. It has a lot of service, a cafeteria, some coffee shop included in the homestay. Breakfast, lunch and dinner maybe? Homestay in Hanoi has quite a beautiful room. It depends on the money you spend on it. But it's usually beautifully decorated. There are two other choices, guest house and luxury hotel. First, let's talk about the luxury hotel. I think it's not suitable because you're coming here to Hanoi to experience our culture. So, in a luxury hotel, I think you're not going to experience the culture. Because it's luxury. It's not from the normal life. And the other reason is the luxury hotel is expensive. I don't really think it's worth it to spend on a luxury hotel for quite a long day. The last option is the guest house. I know a lot of guest houses in Hanoi, but none of them are reasonable for me. Because the first thing is quite old. In the center, it's quite old. And besides that, you don't have the services that you want. No coffee shop, no music.",2

Yes, I think music has very positive effects on infants because firstly, it supports language development of the baby. The baby is born and when at early age, they cannot go to school to learn their mother's language. That's why listening to music is a good passive way of gaining the knowledge and how people would pronounce and to speak a language. It's just an early sense that music gives the baby one or another benefits. It helps develop certain senses for the baby. The baby will develop a sense of relax. It can make the baby more sensitive to words, to the emotions of the people who are talking and which will help them a lot when they grow up. And lastly, the baby can have their creativity enhanced by listening to certain kinds of music, like soft music. They can develop a more romantic feeling and compassion for other people. When listening to hot music, the babies can develop more creativity by developing their creativity to a certain extent. In my country, children learn music at a very young age. As soon as they enter primary school, the music lessons are mandatory because of its importance in the developing phase of the children and the child. My conclusion is music has a lot of benefits on babies and they support the baby throughout their life.",3

It was good, I mean, not to mention that. The second question, what I found the most challenging, it was probably about a few first classes about physics, which is not my strong point ever since the high school. And also the fact that there's just no clear schedule, so I had to make one, which is very annoying. Third question is, what do I do after graduation, which I have. I've graduated for about two years now, I'm working at a government office, which is nice, it pays well.

It can show you a bit more how is the world and if you decide to take a year to work, it can also help you support your studies fees. If you decide to go travel, it's the best way to have new experience and mature, be sure of what you want to do with your life and make some important decisions as to what are you going to study and what are you aiming for can be clearer after a year of thinking about that and making new experience and meeting new people. Of course, the problem of taking a one-year break can you can fall a bit behind with like school results and gradings. You can also never go back to study. That's a risk that is legitimately existing. It's also important when you're doing like very intense studies like medical studies or university studies. I think it's important also to take one year to take care of yourself and focus on your own growth, being able to relax and not just get overwhelmed and risking a meltdown or something like this. In my country, there's not that many people that can do year gap. A lot of people only study between two and five years and they decide to just do it like all together and eventually travel before starting to work. So at the end of their study. Also, I think it's a privilege that not everybody can afford, of course, because it means that for a year, you have to be able to find a job right away and work. I know that like in my own country, it's not that easy to find a job. So you can't necessarily afford to take a year off. And if you're going for travel, same problem. I mean, you have to be able to afford it. I do think that there'll be more and more people that would eventually like take a gap year or there will be more like an exchange between students in school with the possibility of having also like a few months where you don't work while you travel. If you do like one year in a country, you can still enjoy the holidays and have some time to discover our culture and have new experience. Thank you.",3

And I think organizing a vacation in Thailand is a good opportunity for him to acquire more knowledge about the culture and customs. There are several reasons why I don't choose other options. I don't think buying a copper watch is a good choice because it's much expensive. You have to pay about 100 million Vietnam Ton to purchase some watches. Even though taking family photos are interesting and warm, I don't pick it because it's too normal for a meaningful anniversary such as a like wedding.

Because the fast food, they contain a lot of lipids and a lot of salt and we all know that lipids and salt cause very high lipids and salt in the diet. It causes our bad health. Too much lipids can provide overweight and too much salt is not good for our cardiovascular health. So, home-cooked meal is always my first choice over the fast food.

A good teacher has many qualities which can be seen practically in his daily life. Whether it be in school, or at home, or with friends, a good teacher is always a good teacher. The most quality of a good teacher is the love of the job, the love of teaching. Teaching is a practical skill. It's a career skill that most people take in life, particularly as a career or a job to be able to enhance or to be able to meet up with your daily bills in terms of family or in terms of personal life. I would say a good teacher needs to be able to know his teaching methods, be it skills, mentally and physically, have a broad knowledge on the subject and the quality of education which he or she is going to give out. I would say a good teacher can have a great impact on a student's life. Yes, in the sense that the mental aspect of teaching enhances his academic excellence. Academic excellence is derived from your broad skills of teaching. So a good teacher can change a student's life if he is skilled and if he has a broad knowledge on his subject of teaching. In my opinion, I would say a good teacher should be able to have a good knowledge and a good skill in his job, have love for teaching, and can also be practical and full of happiness which enhances him to be able to teach. In my opinion, I do not believe that computers can replace teachers in the future because teaching is a practical skill which comes from methods and experience of teaching which has been embedded in people's lives from the early stages of life. On the other hand, computers are based on technologies which are embedded in their processes and which can also be deleted by a push of a button. So I would think computers would not be able to replace a teacher in the future because teachers are skilled because of their quality of teaching and because of the love of their job and because of their broader knowledge in terms of research and in terms of their skills which they put in their teaching jobs. So the qualities of a good teacher in my conclusions can always be based on broad knowledge, research, skills, and the love of your job. Thank you. .",3

First of all, I would like to talk about its convenience. Being able to study at home in the comfortable of your room is extremely convenient for students. They can eat and schedule or eat, play, work, and schedule their time according to the online learning course. Obviously, it would take less time and work to study at home rather than have to go to school to learn offline. About flexibility, it's also a benefit of the advantage of online learning to traditional learning. The professor will have a flexible time to adjust himself to the student. The student can demand a period of time and they can compromise for each other with each other. For example, the student may be busy throughout the day for work or other stuff and they can compromise with the professor to learn at night. Is the time flexible? There is a space flexible too where students would need to sit at home anywhere at home and can be able to learn from the best professor in the world. It's also affordable as the initial cost for learning equipment is low, it's computer and Wi-Fi. However, it will be relatively cheaper to traditional learning as the school does not have to rent a room, pay for electricity, so the travelling course is also lessened. With online learning, students can experience the best education from the most excellent university in the world as they can be able to learn from Stanford and Harvard. The advantage of online learning compared to the traditional classroom setting is that students cannot see the professor face and the professor cannot directly interact with the children either. The professor would not see that if the student understands or not to adjust accordingly, the interaction from human to human is also lessened. The student will be confined in their own room without being able to cooperate directly with other students and it will significantly lessen the productivity of work projects. Online learning will definitely be more popular in the future despite its advantage. The advantage is our weight.

The first reason why school life is the best time in our life is that we have no less achievement. We learn some lessons in school and we can use it in our life when we grow up. When we are adults, some lessons you learn in your school life can help you in your adult life. The second reason why school life is the best time in our life is that you can have a lifelong friendship. We meet a lot of people in our life and I think the friend you meet in your school is the one who can make you comfortable to be with. The third reason is that you don't have any financial burden. You don't need to think about the financial because the government and your spouse will pay it for you and the only thing you need to do is study. My own idea about school life is that school life can improve your confidence due to your friend, teacher and environment. Your friend will always be your side when you have trouble and they can talk with you and improve your confidence. The teacher and the environment do it too. The best thing I like about my school life is the memory with my friends. We do silly things together and we always chit chat about life.

For many young people, going to the museum offers an opportunity to learn more about history. Young people may have an increased sense of identity and belonging when they visit a museum to learn more about how people used to live in the past. Many young people usually don't visit museums on their own except for when there is an outing with their school or a project or assignment that they need to do for their studies. But how can we encourage young people to go to the museum on their own? I think museums need to do a better job of making the experience more interesting. Perhaps some sort of entertainment would benefit the museum and young people at the same time. They can include people singing about stories of the past or even re-enacting a play or story from a long, long time ago. Many young people learn best by seeing and by doing, by experiencing. So, to cater to the various learning styles, I think museums should include a variety of strategies. Museums may become more popular in the future if they can appeal to the interests of the young people so that they package information, important information, in a way that young people can relate to it. It is important for young people to grow up in a community that is proud of their background, that is proud of where they come from. And so, to instill a sense of pride in young people, it is advisable to make things, make museums more relevant to them. Instead of walking around and looking at the different artefacts, perhaps there could be an audio or perhaps there could be a dance or interpretive act performed so that young people could make more sense of what is happening. Young people would be most encouraged to learn more about the past when they understand how the past affects their future. Young people will see the benefit in learning about the past when they know that everything that happened in the past helps them to make sense of the future and how to move forward.",3

What is the issue that teenagers should be encouraged to live more independently? For the phone, it is understandable that living independently can have some benefits. First, it can boost self confidence. When you live independently, you can certify everything you do. Moreover, it can decrease burden on others like the sex, illness, mental health, or anything you feel burden. Living independently can decrease burden. Moreover, living independently can be more responsible. Because even when you make or work something, you need more thinking, thinking about what you do, what work, or what everything you do. So, make your responsibility more well. I think it also helps you feel comfortable when you live independently. Now, I will answer the follow up question. I think the way my parents teach our children change in the past 10 years is... I think parents in the past 10 years have tended to... What they wanted their children to love or like what they want. And now, children can do everything they want. I think teenagers in my country have more opportunity to live independently in the future.

Going to work immediately, my brother graduates from universities enable him to collect mass experience in his major. Moreover, he will have great chance to expose to the brilliant people or the excellent co-workers in the company. Therefore, he is able to broaden his horizon as well as broaden the circle of his friends. Besides this, the sooner he is going to work, the more experience he has, which makes a contribution to build his career down the road. Sometimes my brother will have great opportunity to share the life experience with other people in working place. There are several reasons. Please don't choose the studying for his master or the giving of chaplains because they take my brother a large amount of time to carry out. Studying for his master will take him about two extra years. Instead of studying for higher education, he can spend that time on developing the social skill and sub-skill as working place.

It's work and family and outside activity. So if the people can balance with their hobbies and work and family together, I think that it will be the success in their life. If people work under higher pressure, we may contract a lot of the physical health and mental health. Maybe it will also be a very dangerous situation for the people. That is not encouraged for people. How do people work with poor work-life balance in society? When people have a happy life, they will be affected by the surrounding people. They will have positive feelings, positive activity and positive words.",3

There are some paintings and artwork that you might find amazing with some historic background that students can learn from. Especially when it relates to how we live now. Some paintings and artwork in these galleries tells you much more about the past just by going to see them than someone explaining to you. Because in the process of someone explaining to you, there are some information that might be omitted so you might not get the full context of what really happened. But by looking at the paintings and looking at the artwork, you can be able to form your own ideas to know what happened, how did it happen. And even know a little more about the creator of the art project or the art work. It's a great way for people who are enthusiastic about art to communicate and talk about some of their favorite paintings, some of their favorite artworks. And another way I think it can be helpful is for students to learn the importance of art work and how it can be translated into other experiences in life. And it's another way to do fundraising for important projects like charities. In most instances when some charities want to help people in developing countries, they use their artwork or they host events and programs at the art galleries for people to come. And raise funds and contribute to whatever good project they are supposed to do or want to do. So I think it's important to encourage students to go and have that experience and learn because it's something that people really don't have much exposure to, including me. I didn't grow up knowing the importance of art until I got older and started to get invited to go and see some of the work that famous people did in the past and the present. And it was amazing to see how these things can translate into words without having any written words on them. How you explore your own mind to know what the actors was thinking, how they were able to come up with something so creative. And how it can translate to your own experience and life. So I think it's good to encourage students. I wish I had the time to carry some of my students to go and see these things and experience it for themselves. And then get to understand and know how important art works are and how important it is to visit.",3

Hello? For university students. Living in hostel will improve networking of the student. For university students, living in hostel benefits university students. I think these are the benefits and the advantages when students are living in hostel. This advantage might be when students live in hostel they will have to live with other people. Some people they will like, some people they don't like. Because people come from every other province. Every province they have their own cultures and their own way to communicate with others. My students might feel they are very comfortable to get to know new friends, but some are not comfortable when getting new friends. What should the university do to attract more students to live in hostel? The university can give the students what other advantages they can have when living in hostel. Like their fees price is lower when they live alone outside. They can meet up with new people and when they have a test or anything else they can talk with their friends about the test. Also, the university can offer students to have a meal, breakfast, dinner, lunch, something like that. When the student lives in the hostel, also every fee price is lower when living outside. What should students take into consideration when choosing where to live? The student needs to take consideration mostly in the price. Their fee when they have to pay when living in hostel or living outside. Also, they need to consider the distance taken from where they live to the university. When they live in the hostel, it's very close to the university because normally the university will set the hostel near the university and the university will go to the university in the most convenient way. When they live outside, they cannot find the best place that's near to the university. So that is some considerations the student needs to make when they choose whether to live outside or live in the hostel that the university offers. Thank you for your attention.",3

I think parent play an important role in the development of each individual. And have the view that parents are the best teacher. I totally agree with this view because of some reason. First, parents understand the student's strengths and weaknesses. Let me see. Of course, there are some people, their birth are the children and to raise them. Of course, there are some people that understand them too much. Secondly, parents are closer to the children than others. Of course, because children have to live with their parents. At the age of no, children have to live with their parents from 18 years old or more. So parents are people closer to the children than others. They can understand the demands, the needs of their child. Third, parents can teach their children with love and responsibility. Of course, because as I mentioned, people live close with their children. They spend a lot of emotions on their children. Children like or think about their parents. So they really respect, really love them. That's all my view about the role of parents and parents are the best of teachers. So I will answer some follow-up questions. The first, what's good for a student who does not have a teacher? Yes, of course, I think parents and teachers can have it also to educate the children. Because when the children come to school, they have the teachers from the teacher. But when they come home, they get the teacher from the parents. So I think the role of parents in the past 10 years is not changeable too much. But I think the parent is open now than in the past. They let their child be more independent than in the past. I think so. I think parents should not intervene in their children's child's career because it belongs to their preference of children. It's a really serious mistake when parents intervene in the child's career.",3

In my opinion, the traditional market is cheaper than supermarkets and is closed with people in Vietnam than supermarkets. For example, my mother usually goes to the traditional market to buy meat, vegetables, and more. But she does not go to the supermarket until she is very busy or she buys a lie. So, a lot of people's shopping habits are changed over. Young people usually go to supermarkets, but older people usually go to traditional markets. Because young people go from 8pm to 15pm, they don't have enough time to go to the traditional market at morning. So, in the evening, only supermarkets open. So, they go there and buy meat, vegetables for their family. I think so. What are the benefits of a traditional supermarket? I think the supermarket advantage is that there are good systems. There are ends to a baroque cuisine. But in Chinese normal market, there are more clothes than people in Vietnam. Time for my listening. This is my speaking.",3

But nowadays, because of the experience of societal network websites, mobile phones and e-mails, the handwriting letters disappear. So there are some reasons that lead to this situation. First of all, societal network websites are very more and more popular nowadays. So we can easily share all the information or communicate with each other. We just need the internet connection. So we don't need the writing letter to communicate. And recently, almost people use mobile phone and e-mail to communicate because they have a lot of benefits. More fast, more convenient. And if handwriting users only send the message to each other, but mobile phone and e-mail can send a lot of things to each other, such as music files, video files. Although the so with all reason, at least below the handwriting letter, were disappeared. But I think, in my opinion, some people still write letters by hand. Because I think if we spend a lot of time to prepare a letter and then send it to each other, the list of the receiving will be happier when receiving these letters. Nowadays, we can make a handwriting letter and send it by e-mail or mobile phone very easy. So we can use this method to send, to use handwriting letters. This is the end of my exam.

And there are three options suggested that planting more trees, building a factory to recycle waste and relocating hospitals to the suburbs. I think the best choice is planting more trees. Because why I choose this? Because planting more trees will give the local environment more green atmosphere. Then the tree will produce more oxygen and more shade for people to play under it. And also for children to relax. And the reason why I didn't choose the choice that building a factory to recycle waste. Because building a factory will cost so much money. And for the money that didn't spend all the money to planting more trees. Building a factory to recycle waste also need more space. And the space to build a factory can be used to planting more trees. And it is more efficient for the environment I think. The other option that I didn't choose is relocating hospitals to the suburbs. Because it costs more than building a factory to recycle waste and planting more trees. And it is also not available now because there are many patients that need to constantly cheat in the hospitals. And if you relocate them to the suburbs, it will cost them life. And secondly, if you relocate hospitals to the suburbs, there are people, there are patients that need to save in the local. You have to go farther and therefore their life will not be sure.

Now I have lived with my family about 20 years in Hanoi. It is our capital city in the north. My hometown is an ideal city for living and also for visitors. This is because our city is considered as a pitfall and a symbol of peace in the world. Our local people in here are very hospitable with visitors. In Hanoi, there are many beautiful landscapes and glamorous sceneries for visitors around the year. I believe that Ho Chi Minh Mall is the most beautiful and mud-striped destination for someone who visits my hometown. There is one season in the year that is best for visitors. I recommend autumn. This visitor can fall head over heels with a meal and watching the yellow leaf falling down the tree-like street. It seems an adorable scenery. I don't know in the future if I can move to another city, but I love Hanoi so much. It keeps all the memories of my childhood until now. Admittedly, I have not got well along with my neighborhood who live next to my house. I just communicate with our parents and old couples who live near my house because they get along with my parents. Sometimes we share so much food or drinks to each other to keep our relationship better. And of course, neighbors are so helpful because sometimes they are more important than our relatives. When you get ill, they will take you to the hospital.",1
